</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The text proper of the present volume is entirely
commercial. In the conclusion of the <i lang="es">Extracto
historial</i>, is seen the continuance, between the merchants of Spain
and the colonies, of the struggle for commercial supremacy. Demands and
counter-demands emanate from the merchants of Cadiz and Manila
respectively; and economic questions of great moment are treated
bunglingly. The jealousy, envy, and distrust of the Cadiz merchants
sees in the increasing prosperity of the Manila trade, especially that
in Chinese silks, only their own ruin. The Manila merchants, on the
other hand, who have the best of the controversy, quite properly object
to an exchange of the silk trade for the exclusive right in the spice
trade. The laws of supply and demand seem to be quite left out of
consideration. The appendix is an attempt to show the influences and
factors making for education in the Philippines during the Spanish
r&eacute;gime, and the various educational institutions in the
archipelago. In it one will see that, while apparently there has been
great activity, results have been meager and superficial.</p>
<p class="par">At the close of the preceding volume, we saw in the
<i lang="es">Extracto historial</i> the &ldquo;Manila plan&rdquo; for
regulating the commerce between the Philippines and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="#pb12" name="pb12">12</a>]</span>Nueva
Espa&ntilde;a, and its adoption (1726) by the Spanish government for a
limited period. Three years later (July, 1729) Cadiz protests against
this concession, complaining of the abuses practiced in the
Manila-Acapulco trade, and of the injury done to Spanish commerce by
the importation of Chinese silks into Nueva Espa&ntilde;a. In
consequence of this, an investigation is ordered in Acapulco and
Mexico, from which it appears that the amount of Manila&rsquo;s
commerce is rapidly increasing; the viceroy therefore advises the home
government to restrict it, as being injurious to the commercial
interests not only of the mother-country but of Nueva Espa&ntilde;a,
especially in the matter of Chinese silks. Meanwhile, he notifies
Manila that the galleon of 1734 must be laden in accordance with the
old scheme, the five years&rsquo; term having expired. At this, Manila
enters a vigorous protest, and demands that the permission of 1726 be
continued to the islands. After much discussion pro and con, a royal
decree is issued (April 8, 1734) to regulate that commerce; the
viceroy&rsquo;s order is revoked, the amount of trade permitted to
Manila is increased, but otherwise the decrees of 1702, 1712, and 1724
shall be in force (with some minor changes). In the following year,
Cadiz again complains of the Manila-Acapulco trade, and proposes that
Chinese silks be excluded from it&mdash;offering, by way of
compensation, to surrender to Manila the exclusive right to the spice
trade in the American colonies. The royal fiscal disapproves this, for
various practical reasons, and recommends that the whole matter be
discussed at a conference in Mexico, attended by delegates from Manila
and Cadiz. The Manila deputies place before the Council another
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href="#pb13" name=
"pb13">13</a>]</span>long memorial (dated March 30, 1735), refuting the
arguments and denying the charges made by Cadiz; the latter&rsquo;s
offer of the spice trade in Nueva Espa&ntilde;a is regarded as useless
and in every way unsatisfactory. Cadiz answers these objections (June
1, 1735), and urges the court to cut off the trade of Manila in Chinese
silks, adducing many arguments therefor. Again the fiscal refuses to
endorse the policy of Cadiz; and the Council call (November 16, 1735)
for a summary report of the entire controversy, with the documents
concerned therein, preparatory to their final review and decision.</p>
<p class="par">The educational appendix, which occupies most of this
volume, opens with a petition from the Manila ecclesiastical cabildo,
to the effect that no religious order be allowed to establish a
university in Manila (as has been petitioned), as such a procedure
would be prejudicial to the secular clergy, by reason of the fact that
the religious would hold all the chairs in such institution. The
petition also recommends that all ecclesiastical posts be given
indiscriminately to members of all the orders until there are
sufficient secular priests to hold them.</p>
<p class="par">The second document, consisting of two parts, relates to
the college of San Jos&eacute;. The first part is the account by Colin
in his <i lang="es">Labor evangelica</i>, and is a brief history of the
institution from its foundation until 1663; the second is a compilation
from various sources. The efforts of the Jesuits for a college are
first realized through the Jesuit visitor, Diego Garcia, who is well
assisted by Pedro Chirino. Luis Gomez, the first rector, secures the
necessary civil and ecclesiastical permissions, in 1601. The college
opens with thirteen fellowships, which are given to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href="#pb14" name="pb14">14</a>]</span>the sons
of influential citizens, a number soon increased to twenty. Rules and
regulations are made for teachers and scholarships. As early as 1596,
Esteban Rodriguez de Figueroa has left directions in his will, in case
either of his minor daughters dies, for the endowment of a college
under the care of the Jesuits. One of his daughters dying, the will
becomes operative, and in consequence, the second establishment of the
college takes place February 28, 1610, the act of foundation being
given. The Jesuits have some trouble in getting the funds decreed by
the will, but are finally successful. In 1647, the college obtains the
favorable decision as to right of seniority in its contest with the
Dominican institution of Santo Tom&aacute;s. The second part of this
document traces (mainly by reference to and citation from original
documents), the history of the college of San Jos&eacute; from its
foundation to the present time, necessarily mentioning much touched
upon by Colin. The royal decree of May 3, 1722, granting the title of
&ldquo;Royal&rdquo; to the college is given entire. The various
fellowships in the college are enumerated. The expulsion of the Jesuits
in 1768 has a direct bearing on the college, which is at first
confiscated by the government, but later restored to the archbishop who
lays claim to it. The latter converts it into an ecclesiastical
seminary, thus depriving its students of their rights; but the king
disapproves of such action, and the college is restored to its former
status and given into the charge of the cathedral officials. Its later
management does not prove efficient, and the college finally falls
under the supervision of the Dominican university. In the decade
between 1860 and 1870, the plans of making a professional school of it
are <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15" name=
"pb15">15</a>]</span>discussed, and in 1875 faculties of medicine and
pharmacy are established there. The Moret decrees of 1870 secularize
the institution, but the attempt is successfully blocked by the
religious orders. Since American occupation of the islands, the
question of the status of the college has been discussed before the
government, and the case is still unsettled.</p>
<p class="par">The next document, consisting of three parts, treats of
the Dominican college and university of Santo Tom&aacute;s. The first
part is the account as given by Santa Cruz, and treats especially of
the erection of the college into a university. After unsuccessful
efforts made by the Dominicans with Pope Urban VII in 1643 and 1644 to
obtain the pontifical permission for this step, it is at length
obtained from Pope Innocent X in 1645. In 1648, the Audiencia and the
archbishop give their consent to the erection. Rules and regulations
are made by the rector of the new university, Fray Martin Real de la
Cruz, in imitation of those of the university of Mexico. The second
part of this document is the royal decree of March 7, 1785, granting
the title of &ldquo;Royal&rdquo; to the institution, on condition that
it never petition aid from the royal treasury. The third part is an
account of the university by Fray Evarista Fernandez Arias, O.P., which
was read at the opening of the university in 1885. He traces briefly
the history of the foundation and growth of the college and university.
Pope Paul V grants authority to it to confer degrees to its graduates
for ten years, a permission that is later prolonged. The brief of
Innocent X erecting the college into a university in 1645 is later
extended by Clement XII in 1734. The first regulations of the
university are revised in 1785, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb16"
href="#pb16" name="pb16">16</a>]</span>when the faculties of law and
theology are extended (the departments of jurisprudence and canon law
having been established early in the eighteenth century). These laws
are the ones still in force in 1885 except in so far as they have been
modified by later laws. It becomes necessary to abolish the school of
medicine and the chairs of mathematics and drawing. In 1836, the chair
of Spanish law is created. Between the years 1837 and 1867 the question
of reorganization is discussed. In 1870, the university is secularized
as the university of the Philippines by the Moret decree, but the
decree is soon repealed. The college of San Jos&eacute; is placed
definitely under the control of the university, and becomes its medical
and pharmaceutical department. In 1876, a notarial course is opened,
and in 1880, courses in medicine, pharmacy, and midwifery are opened.
Since this date the college has had complete courses in superior and
secondary education.</p>
<p class="par">The next document is one of unusual interest because it
is the earliest attempt to form an exclusively royal and governmental
educational institution in the Philippines&mdash;the royal college of
San Felipe de Austria, founded by Governor Sebasti&aacute;n Hurtado de
Corcuera. The first part of this document, which consists of two parts,
is an extract from Diaz&rsquo;s <i lang="es">Historia</i>. Corcuera
assigns the sum of 4,000 pesos annually from the royal treasury for the
support of the twenty fellowships created, those preferences being
designed for the best Spanish youth of Manila. The new institution is
given into the charge of the Jesuits. The college is, however,
suppressed at the close of Corcuera&rsquo;s government, as it is
disapproved by the king, the decree of suppression being inexorably
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href="#pb17" name=
"pb17">17</a>]</span>executed by Fajardo. The Jesuits are compelled to
repay the 12,000 pesos that have been paid them for the support of the
college for the three years of its existence. A later royal college,
called also San Felipe, is created by order of Felipe V. The second
part of the present document is condensed from notes in
Pastells&rsquo;s edition of <i lang="es">Labor evang&eacute;lica</i>,
and is a brief sketch of the founding, duration, and suppression of the
institution founded by Corcuera. The latter founds it at the instance
of the secular cabildo of Manila, and the charge of it is given to the
Jesuits, although the Dominicans offer to dispense with the 4,000 pesos
granted it from the royal treasury. Twenty fellowships and six places
for Pampango servants are created by the act of foundation, December
23, 1640. The 4,000 pesos are met from Sangley licenses. An abstract of
the rules of the new institution, thirty-three in all, is given. They
cover the scholastic, moral, and religious life of the pupils.
Corcuera&rsquo;s letter of August 8, 1641, reporting the foundation and
asking certain favors, is answered by the royal decree of suppression,
which is entrusted to the new governor, Fajardo. The 12,000 pesos,
which the Jesuits are ordered to pay, is repaid them (if they have paid
it) by a royal decree of March 17, 1647, and the incident of the
short-lived college is closed.</p>
<p class="par">The following document&mdash;the summary of a letter
from the famous Archbishop Pardo&mdash;is the answer to a royal decree
ordering the education of natives for the priesthood. He states the
inefficiency of the natives for that pursuit, and the necessity of
sending religious from Spain. It is followed by a royal decree of June
20, 1686, directing the strict observance <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb18" href="#pb18" name="pb18">18</a>]</span>of the laws for native
schools and the study of Spanish in the Spanish colonies.</p>
<p class="par">The college-seminary of San Clemente, or San Felipe, as
it was called later, forms the subject of the next document, which
consists of two parts. The first is a royal decree of March 3, 1710, in
which the king disapproves of the methods employed in the founding of
the seminary which he had ordered Governor Zabalburu to found with 8
seminarists. Instead of following orders, the governor allows the
archbishop and the &ldquo;patriarch&rdquo; Tournon to establish the
institution, which is thrown open to foreigners, and has over eighty
instead of eight seminarists. This disobedience occasions the removal
and transfer of Archbishop Camacho, and the foreigners are ordered to
be expelled, and only sixteen Spanish subjects are to be allowed in the
seminary as boarders, in addition to the eight seminarists. The second
part of the document is from the Recollect historian, Juan de la
Concepci&oacute;n. Governor Cruzat y Gongora, in answer to a royal
decree recommending the establishment of a seminary, declares such to
be unnecessary. Its foundation is, however, ordered, and is finally
consummated, but the conditions of the actual founding, which was
entrusted to the governor, are altered by the neglect of the latter and
the intrusion of Tournon and the archbishop who work in concert. The
king, hearing of the turn affairs have taken, not through direct
communication, but through the papal nuncio, orders the refounding of
the institution along the lines indicated by him, and the name is
changed to San Felipe. The formal founding of the latter is left by the
governor to Archbishop Francisco de la Cuesta, who draws <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19" name="pb19">19</a>]</span>up new
rules, but at the same time deprives the king of the private patronage,
usurping it for himself, although it is a lay creation.</p>
<p class="par">In the following document, the college of San Juan de
Letran is discussed. It is founded in 1640 by Juan Geronimo Guerrero,
for the purpose of aiding and teaching poor orphan boys. Many alms are
given for the work by charitable persons, and Corcuera grants some in
the king&rsquo;s name, and an encomienda in the Pari&aacute;n is given
it. At the same time, a Dominican lay-brother undertakes the care of
poor orphan boys in the porter&rsquo;s lodge of the Manila convent. As
Guerrero ages, finding it impossible to look after his orphan boys, he
entrusts them to the care of the Dominican lay-brother, who has by this
time formed a congregation under the name of San Pedro y San Pablo. The
consolidation is known for some time by the latter name, although the
transfer is made under the name of the College of San Juan de Letran,
which is later definitely adopted. Rules for the college are made by
Sebastian de Oquendo, prior of the Manila convent, which are revised
later by the provincial chapter. After being housed for some years in
the lower part of the convent, the college is moved into a house
opposite the same; but that house being destroyed by the earthquake of
1645, a wooden building is erected outside the walls near the
Pari&aacute;n. In 1669, finding their quarters uncomfortable, as the
students are compelled to go to the university for their studies, the
college is again moved inside the walled city. Priestly, military, and
other professions are recruited from this institution.</p>
<p class="par">A royal decree of June 11, 1792 requires the permission
of the royal representative, and of those in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href="#pb20" name=
"pb20">20</a>]</span>authority at the institutions of learning, for all
students, men and women, attending any such institution subject to the
royal patronage and protection, before the contraction of marriage.
Another decree of December 22, 1792, directs the governor to observe
the previous decrees concerning the teaching of Spanish in schools for
the natives. Nothing but Spanish is to be spoken in the convents.</p>
<p class="par">Conciliar seminaries are treated in a document of two
parts. The first part is a decree of March 26, 1803, in regard to the
three per cent discount which is ordered to be made from the salary of
all parish priests for the maintenance of conciliar seminaries. A
decree of July 30, 1802 is enclosed therein, which orders such
collection, notwithstanding the objections raised by the parish
priests; and the payment must be made in money. Special provisions are
made in regard to the seminary of Nueva Segovia. The second part
consists of extracts from various sources. The first two of the
extracts relate to the five Roman Catholic conciliar seminaries, and
give their status since 1862. The third extract is the provision made
by the Aglipay or independent church of the Philippines for seminaries
for the education of priests, and the plan for the studies to be
carried on therein.</p>
<p class="par">The Nautical school of Manila is also treated in two
parts, the first being a decree of May 9, 1839, approving the new
regulations for the pilots&rsquo; school of July 20, 1837; and the
second extracts from various sources giving a brief history of this
institution which is established first in 1820 by the Consulate of
Commerce, and later taken under control of the government. This school
is now maintained by the Americans. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb21"
href="#pb21" name="pb21">21</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The boys&rsquo; soprano school is an interesting
institution founded by Archbishop Rodriguez in 1742 for the purpose of
furnishing boy singers to the cathedral. The education, which is
chiefly musical, embraces training in both vocal and instrumental
music, although on account of their tender age the boys are, as a
general rule, debarred from using wind instruments. High merit is
obtained by these boys.</p>
<p class="par">Public instruction in the Philippines is discussed by
Mas in the following document. He declares that the education of the
Philippines is in a better state proportionally than it is in Spain.
There are schools in each village, attendance at which is compulsory,
except at seeding and harvest times. Expenses are met from the communal
funds. Women also share in the education. The books commonly used are
those of devotion. Besides communal and private schools there are also
public institutions in Manila. Brief histories and descriptions are
given of the following institutions: university of Santo Tom&aacute;s;
college of San Jos&eacute;; college of San Juan de Letran; the charity
school founded in 1817 by distinguished citizens; the nautical academy;
the commercial school founded in 1840; seminary of Santa Potenciana,
which was founded by a royal decree of 1589; Santa Isabel, founded by
the confraternity of Misericordia, in 1632; beaterio of Santa Catalina
de Sena, founded in 1696; beaterio de San Sebastian de Calumpang,
founded in 1719; beaterio de San Ignacio, founded in 1699; beaterio de
Santa Rosa, founded in 1750; and the beaterio de P&aacute;sig, or Santa
Rita, founded in 1740.</p>
<p class="par">This is followed by Mallat&rsquo;s account, which uses
Mas largely as authority. Mallat praises the advanced state of
education in the Philippines, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb22"
href="#pb22" name="pb22">22</a>]</span>dwells at considerable length on
their culture in poesy and music, and their allied branches of art; and
gives in general a recast of the conditions of the educational
influences in the archipelago.</p>
<p class="par">A superior order of December 2, 1847, legalizes in Spain
degrees taken in the educational institutions of the colonies, and vice
versa; and professions authorized in one country may be practiced in
the other, on sufficient proof. A short document on the academy of
painting, sculpture, and engraving, compiled from various sources,
follows. This academy was founded in 1849 by the <span lang=
"es">Sociedad Econ&oacute;mica de Amigos del Pa&iacute;s</span>, and
reorganized in 1892. Another document, also compiled from various
sources, treats of the Ateneo municipal, which is an outgrowth of the
old Escuela p&iacute;a, which was given into the control of the Jesuits
upon their return to the Philippines in 1859. The latter school
receives its present name in 1865. Its expenses are defrayed by the
community of Manila.</p>
<p class="par">A document taken from <i lang="es">Apuntes
interesantes</i> asserts that the university has many enemies, not
because the Dominicans are in control of it, but because they believe
the study of law unadvisable therein. Such a view is anti-liberal. The
writer believes that the Filipinos would give better results in
medicine and surgery, and the advisability of a medical school could be
sustained, but that medicine and even pharmacy which are both sorely
needed in the islands could be established in the university. Foreign
professors should be allowed to enter. Superstitions, abuses, and
ignorance abound in regard to medicine and pharmacy among the natives.
Drugs are allowed to be sold by peddlers, and adulterations
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href="#pb23" name=
"pb23">23</a>]</span>are frequent. Parish priests are called in to act
as physicians but often only after the native doctor, who works mainly
with charms, has been unable to combat the ailment of his patient. But
for all his inefficiency, the natives prefer their mediquillo to the
priest. Many reforms are needed. The naval school, the author declares,
is poorly organized and directed. The graduates aspire only to fine
berths and are not content to accept what is really within their
powers. The school could profitably be reorganized into a school for
training pilots exclusively for the coasting trade. Primary
instruction, so far as the government is concerned, is in an incipient
state. Spanish is taught only in Manila and some of the suburbs; but
there are schools for boys in the native dialects, and some as well for
girls. The government salaries are not sufficient and priests and
officials find it necessary to determine means for buildings, etc., and
salaries are even paid from the church funds. There is no suitable
director for primary education, but in reading, writing, and religion,
the children are more advanced than those of Spain. The government has
tried to improve the instruction in the Spanish language, and has
succeeded somewhat. The writer advises the government to introduce all
the improvements possible, and to extend the normal school, which has
but slight results at present. Teachers are needed, also.</p>
<p class="par">Montero y Vidal in <i lang="es">Archipi&eacute;lago
filipino</i>, gives a recast of educational conditions in 1886. He
shows that public instruction is somewhat widespread, but that it is
lacking in efficiency. He gives some statistics, but they are
inadequate, owing to the inefficiency of the public officials. The
native lawyers <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href="#pb24" name=
"pb24">24</a>]</span>are poor and they sow discord against Spain. He
strongly recommends industrial education.</p>
<p class="par">The following document on girls&rsquo; schools in Manila
and the provinces contains much of interest. This account, taken from
the Dominican report of 1887, describes and gives a list of the schools
of Santa Isabel, Santa Rosa, Santa Catalina, and La Concordia, or
school of the Immaculate Conception. In these schools primary and
secondary education are given. An account is also given of the school
of San Jos&eacute; of Jaro which was opened first in Ilo&iacute;lo in
1872, but closed in 1877 for lack of funds, and was soon thereafter
re&euml;stablished in Jaro through the intermediation of the bishop.
The convent of San Ignacio, founded in 1669, is directed by the
Jesuits, but after their expulsion is taken charge of by the provisor
of the archbishop. It has had a school since 1883. Various other
institutions where instruction is given to girls are mentioned.</p>
<p class="par">The school of agriculture, both under Spanish and
American dominion, is discussed in the next document. First established
in 1889 by the Spanish government for theoretical and practical
instruction, the school has not had great success. Various agricultural
stations are established in various provinces by the government to
supplement the work of the school. Since American occupation the work
has been taken up, and appropriations made for the building of a school
in the rich agricultural island of Negros.</p>
<p class="par">The last document of this volume, a state discussion
(1890) as to the reorganization of education in the university of Santo
Tom&aacute;s (signed among others by the famous Maura) suggests the
arguments advanced <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25"
name="pb25">25</a>]</span>by both the civil and ecclesiastical
governments in the Philippines. The questions under discussion are: 1.
Whether the ministry has a right to reorganize education in the
university without considering the religious order of the Dominicans.
2. Whether the university may offer legal opposition, and by what
means. The conclusions reached are: 1. The ministry cannot apply the
funds and properties of the university of private origin to any
institution that it organizes; and hence cannot reorganize education in
the university. 2. Should the ministry do so, then the university may
take legal means to oppose such determination, the best method being
through the ordinary court of common law. This is a highly interesting
document, in view of the vital legal educational questions touched
upon, some of which may have application in the present San Jos&eacute;
college case. The educational appendix will be concluded in
<span class="sc">VOL. XLVI</span>.</p>

<p class="par first"><i>[Here] is set forth what occurred in regard to
the commerce of Philipinas from the year 1730 until that of 1733, in
consequence of the practice of the ordinance of the year 1726, with
occasion of the complaint made by the merchants of Andalucia.</i></p>

<p class="par first">128&ndash;162. [In July, 1729, the consulate and
merchants of Cadiz sent to the king a memorial protesting against the
favor recently granted to Manila, which the latter was abusing to such
an extent as to endanger the very existence of the Spanish commerce
with Nueva Espa&ntilde;a. So much Chinese silk had been sent by Manila
to Acapulco that Cadiz had determined to send in this year&rsquo;s
trading-fleet no Spanish fabrics; but this would result in the
destruction of its commerce and of its manufactures. Cadiz claims that
Manila carries away from Nueva Espa&ntilde;a three to four millions of
pesos annually, a sum which falls into the hands of foreigners and
infidels; and asks that the permission given to Manila for the export
of Chinese silks be revoked. The king thereupon ordered the viceroy of
Mexico to see on foot a thorough investigation of the Manila commerce,
its <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30" name=
"pb30">30</a>]</span>actual character and extent, its profits, and
other particulars, which is done. The year 1731 was selected for this
investigation; the sales at Acapulco were unusually profitable that
year, as all kinds of fabrics were then scarce in Nueva Espa&ntilde;a,
and the Chinese goods were advanced 25 per cent over their usual
prices. The officials found that the total sales from that year&rsquo;s
cargo amounted to 2,096,874 pesos (making the average value of each
pieza of lading more than 500 pesos); deducting from this the royal
duties, 229,547 pesos (including the contribution of 20,000 pesos made
by the shippers), the amount of returns for the citizens of Manila was
1,877,327 pesos. This amount would probably be equaled in subsequent
voyages of the galleon (even if the sales at Acapulco were not so
profitable), so long as the present permission continued; for the 500
half-chests of Chinese fabrics made an enormous amount, and of great
value. The amount of silver embarked that year for Filipinas was as
follows: &ldquo;1,691,465 pesos, as proceeds of the merchandise sold at
the fair that year [this being the previously-mentioned amount, with
the royal duties deducted from it]; 566,828, in sums remaining from the
previous year; and 175,828, on the account of his Majesty for the royal
situado and other special situados of those islands, and for the pay of
the crew of the galleon.&rdquo; Investigation being made of the past
years of this commerce, &ldquo;the castellan of Acapulco replied, that
from the year 1692 until that of 1702 the Philipinos had been able to
lade their ships with goods to the value of 250,000 pesos, the returns
for which were 500,000 pesos, without assigning a definite number of
piezas&mdash;in which time they paid for all kinds of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31" name="pb31">31</a>]</span>duties
75,000 pesos, which was equivalent to thirty per cent on the cargo and
fifteen per cent on the returns. That in the year 1702 their permission
had been increased to 300,000 pesos of capital [invested], and 600,000
of returns, with the obligation of paying for the shipment of the
latter a charge of two per cent. This had been punctiliously observed
until the year 1717, when other quantities [of merchandise] had been
shipped outside of the permitted amount, for the causes and reasons
which would appear from the acts drawn up on account of this
proceeding; and for what was thus shipped outside the permission duties
had been paid at four per cent (which amounted to 365,000 pesos), and
adding to this the six per cent of alcavala,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e614src" href="#xd21e614" name="xd21e614src">1</a> the duties were
ten per cent, which was collected. That this regulation had been in
vogue up to the year 1720, in which the Marqu&eacute;s de Valero had
allowed to the Philipinos the lump payment of 100,000 pesos which
before had been refused them, including in this amount all the dues
which they must pay [to the royal treasury], and permitting to them, as
before, the shipment of the 600,000 pesos of returns; and that,
although this amount only was what they ought to embark in virtue
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href="#pb32" name=
"pb32">32</a>]</span>of the permission, they carried other funds also
(and not a few)&mdash;the reason being that many persons were resolving
at that time to become citizens of the islands, and, as consequently
their wealth must be conveyed thither, the papers had been given to
them for doing so, in virtue of which they embarked their funds, paying
on them ten per cent. That for the last ten years many sums of money
had gone to Philipinas outside of the permitted amount, on various
warrants, for which orders had been previously given, regarding which
the bureau of accounts could supply information; but, as in this matter
the officials acted independently of the castellan, he had been unable
to take cognizance of those transactions.&rdquo; The royal officials of
Acapulco&mdash;who, with the castellan, were at that time in the City
of Mexico&mdash;advised the viceroy not to make any change in the
permission for the next annual galleon; and gave as their opinion that,
comparing the shipments of merchandise, returns therefrom, and duties
paid to the treasury, by Manila in the last forty years, <i>if in those
islands there had not been an increase of their commerce, at least it
had not declined</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e626src" href=
"#xd21e626" name="xd21e626src">2</a> The officials regarded the present
amount of trade granted to Manila as far in excess of what it had
before (on which earlier amount the islands had been able to support
themselves), and the great withdrawal of money from Nueva Espa&ntilde;a
as injurious to the commerce of both that country and Espa&ntilde;a;
and they advised that the permission be reduced to 2,750 piezas of
Philippine products and ordinary fabrics, and 250 half-chests of
Chinese fabrics. If this were <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href=
"#pb35" name="pb35">35</a>]</span>done, Manila would still have a
million pesos of returns, even after deducting all the duties and
imposts, which would surely be enough, since before they had maintained
themselves with 600,000 pesos annually. As it was, the royal revenue
was much impaired, since the duties paid by Manila now did not include
certain ad valorem duties imposed under the old arrangement. At the
command of the viceroy, the bureau of accounts of Mexico furnished him
a summary of all the remittances of money from Nueva Espa&ntilde;a to
Manila during the years 1723&ndash;31 inclusive; this report showed
that in each year more than the amount of the permission had been
conveyed&mdash;sometimes stated as arrearages from previous shipments,
sometimes as allowed by special permit from the viceroy. The yearly
situado was stated as being 250,000 pesos, the amount actually sent
being such balance of this sum as remained to the credit of Manila in
the treasury of Mexico, which varied yearly from 73,000 to 93,000
pesos. The galleon of 1731 had carried the following cargo: 2,767
bales, 477 chests (of Chinese silks), 554 bags of cinnamon, 147 cakes
of wax, 51 cases of porcelain, 296&frac12; arrobas of storax,
1,977&frac12; arrobas of pepper; besides this, and outside of the
permission, four half-bales and nineteen chests were sent by the
religious orders in Manila&mdash;Dominicans, Franciscans, Augustinians,
and Hospitallers of St. John of God&mdash;for the clothing of the
religious in their hospices in the City of Mexico; and by the governor,
Marqu&eacute;s de Torre-Campo, 45 piezas for (purchasing?)
furniture.]</p>

<p class="par">163&ndash;185. [The viceroy, Marqu&eacute;s de
Casa-Fuerte, wrote to one of the royal Council, Don Joseph
Pati&ntilde;o (November 1, 1731), giving his opinion in regard
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href="#pb36" name=
"pb36">36</a>]</span>to the regulation of the Philippine commerce.
Estimating roughly the returns from the annual Manila galleon at
2,000,000 pesos when before the sum of 600,000 only was allowed, he
regards the present permission as injurious to the commerce of
Espa&ntilde;a and to the commercial interests of Nueva Espa&ntilde;a as
well; for three vessels come from Philipinas to one trading-fleet from
Espa&ntilde;a, and, by carrying out of the country some six millions of
pesos, they render the disposal of the merchandise brought on the
fleets difficult, besides handing over the treasures of the Spanish
domain to infidels. He advocates the reduction of the permission to
such amount as will produce not more than 1,000,000 pesos of returns
for Manila; and thinks that there is foundation for the remonstrances
of the Spanish merchants, although they have exaggerated the amount of
the money sent to Manila and the damage to their own trade therefrom.
That damage arises almost entirely from the Chinese silks and ribbons
sent to Acapulco, which at the fair in that year (1731) were sold for
the estimated amount of a million pesos; he therefore recommends that
Manila be strictly prohibited from shipping to Acapulco any silk, of
any kind or quality whatsoever, except raw, twisted, and floss silk,
hose, and white sayasayas; and that the value and amount of all the
goods sent thither be judiciously regulated, so that prices may be kept
within bounds. This result also depends considerably on the fact that
in Mexico large quantities of cotton are raised, from which are made
various fabrics; &ldquo;and in the bishopric of La Puebla the elephant
stuffs (which are a sort of Rouen cloth, but made from cotton, which
serves for the shirts of very poor people, and for the linings of
garments, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37" name=
"pb37">37</a>]</span>like the thin hollands), which form a considerable
part of the cargo of the ship from Philipinas, are so well imitated
that they would and do check a rise in the prices of the cotton goods
from China. In this City [of Mexico] all the raw silk which comes from
Philipinas (a sufficient amount, so that the fleets [from
Espa&ntilde;a] do not bring it) is worked up, and in this industry many
poor persons are employed, thus obtaining a suitable means of
livelihood; and the fabrics which are made by them are consumed in this
kingdom only.&rdquo; With these restrictions and precautions, the
viceroy would recommend that the regulations of 1726 continue. He would
also remit the payment now made by the citizens of 20,000 pesos
annually to the treasury; but this loss, and that in the customs duties
from the lack of the Chinese silks, would be recompensed by the better
sales which would thus be afforded to the Spanish silk goods. In
January, 1732, the viceroy consulted his fiscal, who thought that the
Manila trade should be restricted, say to a million pesos of
investments, and prohibiting the Chinese silks; that this would benefit
the Spanish traders, and would also secure the opening of Peru to trade
with Nueva Espa&ntilde;a. In the following month, the viceroy called
together a junta of auditors and other experienced persons to discuss
this subject; they favored Manila, and advised that no definite action
be taken as yet. The viceroy, hearing that from Mexico and other cities
more than 1,500,000 pesos in silver was being sent to Acapulco,
presumably intended for Filipinas, felt the necessity of taking
measures to prevent the despatch of too much merchandise from Manila in
the future galleons, since the five years&rsquo; term allowed to that
city would expire <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38"
name="pb38">38</a>]</span>in 1733. He therefore referred to the junta
the question whether he should write to Manila that the galleon of 1734
must come with a cargo in accordance with the former plan of 300,000
pesos&rsquo; investment and 600,000 for returns; and whether he should
enforce the decree of 1720 by prohibiting that galleon from carrying
any Chinese silks. The junta decided both these questions in the
affirmative, advising the viceroy to notify Manila
accordingly&mdash;these regulations to be made, provided that the king
meanwhile did not give new orders. The viceroy therefore sent
despatches to Don Fernando Vald&eacute;s Tam&oacute;n, the governor of
Filipinas, and to the city of Manila, to that effect (March 20 and 25,
1732);<a class="noteref" id="xd21e652src" href="#xd21e652" name=
"xd21e652src">3</a> and on April 3 <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb39"
href="#pb39" name="pb39">39</a>]</span>following sent a report of all
these proceedings to Don Joseph Pati&ntilde;o. He recommends that
Manila be allowed only 3,000 piezas in all, of which only 100
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href="#pb40" name=
"pb40">40</a>]</span>chests be permitted for the finer grades of cotton
goods, entirely prohibiting the silk goods from China, except those
mentioned in his letter of November 1 preceding; that besides the 3,000
piezas, the citizens be allowed to send wax and porcelain at their
pleasure, as these are commodities of little value, and needed by Nueva
Espa&ntilde;a; that any smuggled silks be publicly burned, and very
rigorous penalties imposed on transgressors; that more rigorous
inspection of the lading be made at Manila, to prevent any contraband
goods being sent, not only in the shipments of traders, but in the
chests of passengers, officers, and others on the galleons; that
suspected packages be opened at Acapulco; that the returns sent back to
Manila be in no case allowed to exceed a million of pesos; and that the
contribution of 20,000 pesos be remitted to the Manila shippers.]</p>
<p class="par">186&ndash;188. [The viceroy&rsquo;s letter was referred
to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href="#pb41" name=
"pb41">41</a>]</span>royal Council; the deputies from
Filipinas&mdash;at that time, Lorenzo de Rugama y Palacio, and Miguel
Fernandez Munilla&mdash;thereupon asked for all the documents belonging
to the Council which bore upon this subject; the Council consented
(March 26, 1733) to do so, with the reservation of certain documents,
and the deputies then drew up a long memorial protesting against the
proposed restrictions on their commerce.]</p>
<p class="par">189&ndash;190. [This memorial may be &ldquo;reduced to
five points: In the first it is proved that, for the preservation of
the islands, and the propagation of the Catholic faith in them and in
the adjoining regions, their commerce with Nueva Espa&ntilde;a is
necessary. In the second, it is declared that for the above result it
is necessary that the commerce be carried on and allowed with a capital
corresponding to the returns of 1,200,000 pesos every year. In the
third, it is made plain that returns to that amount are impossible, if
the traffic in the silken fabrics and goods from China, and their
transportation, are prohibited to the merchants of Manila. In the
fourth, it is demonstrated that no value should be attached to the
exaggerated statement that damages will ensue to the commerce of
Espa&ntilde;a if that of Manila be allowed to embark and convey silk
fabrics to Acapulco. In the fifth, it is explained how desirable is the
continuation of the last regulation of the commerce, granted to the
islands in the year 1726; and the advantages which result from that
ordinance, notwithstanding the representations made by the
viceroy.&rdquo; This memorial presents a brief r&eacute;sum&eacute; of
the various royal orders and decrees and the principal events connected
with the Manila-Acapulco commerce during its history, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42" name="pb42">42</a>]</span>from
1587 to 1726; another, of the investigations made by the viceroy of
Mexico regarding the galleon of 1731; and another, of the proceedings
of the junta which he called together for discussion of the measures to
be taken regarding the galleon of 1734. Then the above five points are
considered <i>seriatim</i>, and at considerable length&mdash;mainly by
restating and enforcing the arguments formerly employed, rather than by
adducing new ones. In section i, the king is reminded that the islands
serve as a safeguard and defense to Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, and have kept
the foreigners, infidels, and pagans of the East from getting a
foothold therein by way of the Pacific coast; and it closes thus:
&ldquo;Thus, Sire, if this commerce ceases&mdash;the only foundation on
which rests the maintenance of these islands&mdash;the Spaniards will
abandon them; without their protection, the [religious] ministers will
be persecuted to the utmost; the works of piety and charity in which
the holy house of La Misericordia and the other foundations in Manila
distribute enormous sums will cease; the religious orders will be
reduced to uselessness; those villages will be desolated, by which your
Majesty will lose many vassals; the foreigners and infidels adjoining
those countries will make themselves masters of the islands; and (which
is most cause for grief), when the fortunate advancement of our
religion which has been secured there ceases, those who had embraced
the faith will go to seek their living in the lands of the pagans, with
evident risk of relapsing into the errors which they had detested.
These dangers are worthy of the profound consideration of your Majesty,
and cannot be averted if the commerce of Philipinas with Nueva
Espa&ntilde;a fails.&rdquo; In section ii, the deputies protest
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43" name=
"pb43">43</a>]</span>against the returns of 1731 being made the
standard for the regular value of this commerce, as the gains of that
year&rsquo;s Acapulco fair were phenomenally large. They declare that
in order to maintain themselves they need not less than 1,200,000 pesos
annually, especially as the number of citizens in Manila is now larger
than in former years&mdash;in view of which, the amount for which they
ask is very moderate, being even less in proportion than it was then.
The following statements of population are interesting: in
1636&ndash;37, the number of Spaniards in Manila was 230; in 1702,
there were 400; and in 1722, 882, a number which has since increased
[this memorial being prepared in 1733]. What Manila asks will barely
allow to each inhabitant, on the average, an investment of 800 pesos,
which is hardly enough for a decent mode of living. What encouragement
does this give to Spaniards to settle in such a country, and how can
they thus better their fortunes? The opinions of various high officials
(including viceroys of Mexico) are cited in support of this claim. Not
only the Spaniards who are citizens of Manila are to be considered in
this question, but the two millions of Christian natives who depend on
the Spanish power, not to mention the 1,500 ecclesiastics who are
occupied in maintaining the Catholic faith in the islands. In section
iii, it is argued that the people of Filipinas must be allowed the
trade in Chinese silks in order to secure any profit from their
commerce. Manila claims that the restrictions imposed by the decree of
1720 were procured by the efforts of Cadiz, without the consent of the
people of Filipinas, to whom those restrictions brought much distress;
that the Acapulco trade was granted to them in the first <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44" name="pb44">44</a>]</span>place in
order to attract Spaniards as colonists, in order that intercourse with
them might be the means of entrance and extension for the Catholic
faith among pagans and infidels; that Espa&ntilde;a produces hardly
enough silk goods for its own consumption, and imports much from
foreign countries, so that there is no just reason for prohibiting this
trade to Filipinas. &ldquo;Since what the Sangleys chiefly trade in is
the silken fabrics and ribbons, if the shipment of these goods to Nueva
Espa&ntilde;a is forbidden that is the same as prohibiting intercourse
with the Sangleys, because the consumption of the said silks and
ribbons is very small, or not any, in Philipinas.&rdquo; The customs
duties and alcavalas on the silk trade at Manila amount to some 40,000
pesos a year, which would be lost to the royal treasury by the failure
of that trade; it will also have no means with which to buy the rice
produced by the Indians. No profit can be made on the linens and other
common fabrics prescribed in the decree of 1720, as they are of little
esteem in Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, and the demand for them is small, as
also is their value, &ldquo;since in one bale of these goods only the
value of sixty or seventy pesos can be contained.&rdquo; If at the
Acapulco fair these goods, even when the amount shipped is uncertain,
bring prices so low that there is but little profit over the duties,
freight-charges, and other costs, it may be imagined how unprofitable
this sort of investment will be when (if that decree be enforced) the
buyers there regard the cargo as composed mainly of these goods,
&ldquo;and the venders are not able to practice the maxim of concealing
the [amount of the] merchandise, in order to secure the highest price
for it, its abundance, which lowers the price, not being known.&rdquo;
The <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href="#pb45" name=
"pb45">45</a>]</span>sayasayas and hose, the only form of silk fabrics
permitted to Manila, are productive of but little profit; and even that
would be entirely lost if they were shipped in large enough quantities
to complete the amount of investment allowed to Manila, for the prices
in Nueva Espa&ntilde;a would thus be greatly lowered. Even if this were
not so, one voyage of the galleon would so fully provide the warehouses
of Mexico that no more would be needed for the next three or four
years, which would ruin Manila&rsquo;s market for these goods. It is
impossible that of these bulky goods any adequate quantity could be
shipped within the number of piezas at present allotted to the citizens
of Manila, which, indeed, is all that their one galleon can carry.
Manila claims that the viceroy had no right to give the order regarding
the galleon of 1734, and that both he and the junta rashly assumed that
the prosperous Acapulco fair of 1731 was the standard by which to judge
the results of that commerce&mdash;when in reality that was an
accidental and unusual success; nor did the royal officials of Acapulco
propose that the trade in Chinese silks should be prohibited to Manila,
but only that the number of 4,000 piezas allowed it should be reduced.
Section iv refutes the arguments brought forward by Andalusia against
the trade in Chinese silks as injuring Spanish trade and manufactures,
declaring them to be exaggerations and misrepresentations of the real
facts. &ldquo;It has very recently been made evident by that very
commerce [of Cadiz] that the fabrics of Espa&ntilde;a are not able to
supply those provinces [of America], by the fact that in the company
which, with the name of &lsquo;Philipinas,&rsquo; has been established
in the city of Cadiz, by royal decree of March <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46" name="pb46">46</a>]</span>29, in
this present year of 1733, among the articles and agreements which have
been set down therein is one providing that in each ship of those which
(without limitation) may be allowed to them for their traffic the
silken fabrics from China may be freighted, to the extent of fifty
toneladas, a little more or less; and, bringing those goods to these
kingdoms [of Espa&ntilde;a], they may sell them therein&mdash;not for
consumption here, for this is prohibited; but that they may export
those goods to foreign countries and to America, where they may be sold
and consumed. From this it is evident, in spite of the complaints which
the commerce of Cadiz has so often repeated on this point&mdash;while
the merchants of Manila have never consented to this company, rather,
always protesting and speaking against it, and when what may be offered
to them is found by experience to be prejudicial to the preservation
and maintenance of those islands&mdash;that the silk goods which are
made in Espa&ntilde;a are of so small amount that they cannot supply
America, nor can those of China injure the consumption and satisfactory
disposal of the Spanish goods.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e703src" href="#xd21e703" name="xd21e703src">4</a> Manila claims
that this new company will <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href=
"#pb47" name="pb47">47</a>]</span>draw from the Spanish empire a much
greater quantity of silver for the benefit of infidels than Manila can
spend in buying the goods which have been sent thence to Acapulco; and
that Cadiz has no room for complaints against the other commerce, since
its own merchants are interested in this company&mdash;and all without
the weighty motives which led to the concession of the Philippine
commerce, the propagation of the Catholic faith, the preservation of
the Spanish power in Eastern Asia, and the advancement of the Christian
religion there. The establishment of this &ldquo;Royal Company of
Philipinas,&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href="#pb48"
name="pb48">48</a>]</span>in which traders of Cadiz have shares, shows
plainly that all their complaints against the injuries to Spanish
commerce from the Manila silk-trade were &ldquo;merely a pretext for
their securing the slender profits which that trade yielded to the
islands.&rdquo; The trading-fleets and galleons which are sent out from
Cadiz every two years are laden mainly with products made by foreign
nations&mdash;English, Dutch, Genoese, Venetians, and others&mdash;and
this traffic alienates from the Spanish crown each year more than eight
millions of pesos; and even greater drain of money results from the
traffic which those foreign nations carry on in the Indias.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e732src" href="#xd21e732" name="xd21e732src">5</a>
Much more money is taken out of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb49"
href="#pb49" name="pb49">49</a>]</span>Nueva Espa&ntilde;a by the
Spanish trading-fleets, laden mainly with articles produced by
foreigners and shipped thither by the merchants of Cadiz, than by the
Manila galleon which carries thither goods bought from the Chinese. In
the former case, the money is used to injure and harass the Spanish
power; in the second, it goes to the Chinese, who are able neither to
invade Spanish territory nor to aid the enemies of the crown. These
foreign trading nations, moreover, carry to China and other countries
of Eastern Asia more than four millions of pesos of Mexican and
Peruvian coinage, which they spend there for the purchase of silks and
other commodities, &ldquo;in order to introduce these goods into the
Indias, either illicitly or through the agency of the traders of
Cadiz.&rdquo; In the junta convened by the viceroy of Mexico in
February, 1732, one of the leading arguments for continuing the
increased permission to Manila was, &ldquo;that the returns of silver
produced by the fabrics of foreign manufacture which the aforesaid
[traders of Cadiz] send in fleets and galleons to the Indias were in
tens of millions, which from the ports of Espa&ntilde;a pass to foreign
dominions, and from <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href="#pb50"
name="pb50">50</a>]</span>these to the infidels of the Orient.&rdquo;
The aforesaid Company of Philipinas has obtained permission that in
each ship sent out by its members (the number of vessels not being
limited) they may convey, besides the goods, the amount of 500 pesos
fuertes in silver money&mdash;more or less, according to the needs of

change for gold any surplus that may be left of that capital.<a class=

This permission leads to the drain of much silver from the country,
opens the door for great frauds, and is manifestly unfair to Manila if
the latter is to be deprived of its China trade. As for the ruin of the
silk industry in Espa&ntilde;a, &ldquo;the city of Sevilla itself
openly confessed (in a memorial dated April 24, 1696) that the ruin of
its looms and the deterioration of its commerce arose from the single
cause of the manufactures which the French, English, and Dutch had,
since the middle <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51" name=
"pb51">51</a>]</span>of the past century, introduced into their
dominions, and from the lack of assiduous industry in the natives of
these [kingdoms of Espa&ntilde;a]; and that for this reason those
peoples carried to their own countries our wools, in order to return
them in the shape of cloths and other goods, which their industry was
able to manufacture from those wools. The same thing occurs with the
silks which (as we are experiencing) they are introducing into these
kingdoms, [made] from the [raw] silk which they obtain here; and they
sell in the Orient various stuffs and fabrics, with which usually the
people of rank in these kingdoms are clothed; and such people in the
Indias wear the goods which the merchants of Espa&ntilde;a convey in
fleets and galleons&mdash;as may be known by the books of the customs
duties, in which appears all the above, and the increased amount of
silken fabrics which the foreigners are introducing through the port of
Cadiz, and others that open on the Mediterranean Sea.&rdquo; Cadiz is
reminded that its commerce penetrates into Peru, Buenos Ayres,
Honduras, and other regions which are forbidden to Manila; that it has
no more successful fairs in Peru than in Nueva Espa&ntilde;a (indeed,
obtaining even larger profits in the latter country); notwithstanding
the alleged ruinous competition of Manila; and that the contraband
trade carried on in the Western Indias by the foreign industrial
nations causes far more damage to Cadiz than does the small amount of
trade allowed to Manila. Cadiz has made no complaint against the
shipment by Manila of stuffs from India and spices, doubtless because
the prohibition of these would injure the trade of the English<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e756src" href="#xd21e756" name="xd21e756src">7</a>
and the Dutch, from <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="#pb52"
name="pb52">52</a>]</span>whom Manila buys those goods, and whom Cadiz
favors and tries to enrich at the expense of the Philippine vassals of
the crown, regardless of the injurious effects of such procedure on the
propagation of the faith and the welfare of the former heathen who have
been converted to it in the East. Manila asserts that the necessity of
buying Chinese goods for the maintenance of the islands, and the
increasing competition of the European nations in Eastern markets, have
so raised the prices of those goods that Manila no longer can obtain
the large profits which they formerly brought in Nueva Espa&ntilde;a,
but must now sell them at a very moderate advance over their cost
(including of course therein transportation, duties, etc.). The prompt
despatch of the Manila galleon from Acapulco has been caused mainly by
the necessity of its sailing at certain times to secure favorable winds
and weather; but this haste has been an injury to the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53" name="pb53">53</a>]</span>Manila
shippers, &ldquo;for it hinders them from selling their goods at a
higher value, so they often dispose of them, for this reason, at the
prices that the Mexicans are willing to pay for them, and at other
times leave them for sale on commission [<i lang="es">en
encomienda</i>], with the danger of losing them, and with the evident
arrearage which is caused to the shippers by the lack of the money
[which should have been received] from their sale, for use in their
investments in the following galleon.&rdquo; The memorial concludes
with section v, in which Manila urges, in view of all the foregoing,
that the permission of 1726 be continued to the islands, and
consequently, that the recent orders of the viceroy of Nueva
Espa&ntilde;a regarding the lading of the next galleon be revoked.
These orders were at least premature, as the shipments from Manila
under the new permission did not begin until 1730, so that the galleon
of 1734 was entitled to a cargo of the sort allowed therein; moreover,
the viceroy acted against the advice of the junta which he had convened
to discuss this question. Manila claims that in 1732 the galleon did
not carry back to the islands even what they needed for their
maintenance, the returns from its cargo (although that contained the
4,000 piezas of permission) amounting to only 1,100,000 pesos; and in
the present year of 1733 the returns will be hardly one-half of what
the shippers received, on the average, in the years preceding the new
permission&mdash;the Acapulco fair being a poor one this year, on
account of the large cargoes brought by the fleet from Cadiz, and the
large amount of fabrics brought by &ldquo;the English ship.&rdquo;
Manila needs 1,200,000 pesos annually, at the least; and in order to
secure that amount needs the extension of trade <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href="#pb54" name=
"pb54">54</a>]</span>permitted in 1726. The returns of 1731, as has
been proved, cannot be taken as the measure of its value, especially
when allowance is made for the possibility of storms, shipwreck, or
other disaster to the galleon. Manila also asks that if the returns
should fall below 1,200,000 pesos, its annual contribution of 20,000
pesos to the royal treasury be dispensed with. The king is reminded of
the great services which the people of Filipinas have always rendered
to the crown, in opposing the encroachments of the Dutch and others
against the Spanish power in the East, in defending the natives of the
islands against the Moro pirates, in contributions for building royal
ships and for meeting other pressing needs of the royal treasury, and
always freely offering their lives and their property for the defense
or aid of the crown&mdash;to say nothing of their devotion to the
observance and extension of the Catholic faith, their support of
missionaries, and their zeal in converting the heathen. Manila asks for
the extension in perpetuity of the permission of 1726, with various
minor concessions; if this be not granted, then it is asked for another
five years, with the proviso that no change be made at the instance of
Andalusia only, or without opportunity being given to Manila to express
its wishes and set forth its needs.]</p>
<p class="par">191&ndash;192. [This memorial was sent by the Council to
the fiscal; his reply was handed in on November 10, 1733. He thinks
that the islands need indispensably the traffic to Nueva Espa&ntilde;a,
including the Chinese silks, notwithstanding the remonstrances of the
viceroy of that country; and that the prohibition made by the latter
ought to be raised. Moreover, he finds that the royal treasury is the
gainer by the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55" name=
"pb55">55</a>]</span>new arrangement: the duties up to 1702 amounted to
74,000 pesos, and from that time to 1729, to 100,000 pesos; but in 1730
(the first year in which goods were shipped under the permission of
1726) the duties, including the 20,000 pesos of contribution, were
202,754 pesos, and in the following year 229,552 pesos. He would not
make a positive regulation regarding the Manila-Acapulco trade until
the five-years&rsquo; term is completed; but he makes the following
recommendations: that the commerce be free in all kinds of goods, not
excluding the Chinese silks and ribbons, but that the lading of the
galleon be restricted to 3,600 piezas, of which 400 may be in those
silk goods and others which do not allow the use of the press; and that
the duties on all packages be the same as those specified in the decree
of 1726, and that Manila be freed from the contribution of 20,000
pesos. He also recommends that Manila be allowed to send wax in cakes
of eighteen (instead of twelve) arrobas net; and that his proposed
arrangement be put in force for five years, in order to test its
practicability&mdash;or, if the king so prefer, that the decree of 1726
be extended for another term of five years.]</p>
<p class="par">193&ndash;197. [In this place is presented the
informatory report of the royal accountant at Mexico to the viceroy in
1730, because it is frequently cited in this controversy; but it is
concerned mainly with the size of the packages on the Manila
galleon.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e783src" href="#xd21e783" name=
"xd21e783src">8</a> It appears <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb56"
href="#pb56" name="pb56">56</a>]</span>that these were measured by the
vara <i>de Ribera</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e821src" href=
"#xd21e821" name="xd21e821src">9</a> instead of the Castilian vara, the
former being &ldquo;longer than the Castilian, by four dedos and part
of another;&rdquo; but allowance was afterward made for this
difference. Ardila, the accountant, also recommended to the viceroy the
enlargement of Manila&rsquo;s permission to 1,200,000 pesos of returns,
and the reopening of the commerce between Nueva Espa&ntilde;a and Peru.
The royal Council discussed the fiscal&rsquo;s reply and other
documents, and advised the king (December 19, 1733) to order the
viceroy to recall his obnoxious orders relative to the galleons of 1734
and succeeding years, and to regulate the cargoes by the decrees in
force from 1712 to 1720&mdash;&ldquo;excluding absolutely the
regulation of the permission by piezas, and commanding that this be
made in future strictly by invoices and sworn declarations.&rdquo; The
ministers did not agree on the question of the amount of returns to be
permitted to Manila, five being of opinion that no change should be
made in the allowance of 300,000 pesos of investment and 600,000 of
returns, and the five others advocating an increase to 500,000 and
1,000,000 pesos respectively. (The names of the first five are: Don
Manuel de Sylva, the Marqu&eacute;s de Almodobar, Don Antonio de
Sope&ntilde;a, Don Fernando Verdes Montenegro, and Don Francisco
Antonio de Aguirre; of the last five, Don Diego de Zu&ntilde;iga, the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href="#pb57" name=

Iba&ntilde;ez de Mendoza, Don Antonio Alvarez de Abreu, and Don Joseph
de Valdiviesso. Abreu was the compiler of the <i lang=
"es">Extracto</i>.) The reasons for each of these opinions are given in
detail.]</p>
<p class="par">198&ndash;200. [When this opinion was ready to be sent
to the king, letters arrived from the governor and Audiencia of
Filipinas, remonstrating against the orders of the viceroy regarding
the galleon of 1734. At the same time, the Manila deputies at Madrid
presented another memorial to the Council, which accordingly held a new
conference over this matter. On December 23 (after having consulted the
fiscal), they reported to the king their opinion, which they said had
not been changed by the aforesaid despatches. The king approved of
their advice in regard to recalling the viceroy&rsquo;s orders, and in
regard to the controverted point of the amount which should be allowed
to Manila, he approved the opinion of Zu&ntilde;iga and his associates,
that of the increase to 500,000 and 1,000,000 pesos. The letters from
the governor and Audiencia ask that the cargoes be estimated by piezas,
and propose 300 or 400 chests of Chinese silk goods, instead of the 500
formerly asked; the memorial of the deputies urges that the sales for
the first three of the five years had averaged only 1,350,000 pesos,
and the succeeding ones could not exceed 1,200,000 pesos, which latter
sum was necessary for the preservation of the islands.]</p>
<p class="par">201&ndash;212. [On February 23, 1734, the Manila
deputies presented a new memorial, under eight heads, making various
minor requests in regard to the new regulation for the commerce, some
of which were granted, and some refused. On April 8, a royal decree
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href="#pb58" name=
"pb58">58</a>]</span>was issued making such regulation;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e839src" href="#xd21e839" name="xd21e839src">10</a>
after briefly reviewing the various proceedings and documents which had
appeared since the decree of 1726, command is given that the
viceroy&rsquo;s orders be revoked, and the commerce continued in
accordance with the decrees of 1702, 1712, and 1724&mdash;prohibiting
the valuation on the basis of piezas, and prescribing that this be
accomplished by invoices and sworn <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb59"
href="#pb59" name="pb59">59</a>]</span>declarations; and increasing the
amount of the trade permitted to Manila to 500,000 pesos of investment
and 1,000,000 of returns. As for duties, they shall be paid as
commanded in the decree of 1702 (which fixed 100,000 pesos as the
amount to be paid at Acapulco for the round trip of the galleon),
<i>pro rata</i> therewith on the increase from 300,000 to 500,000
pesos; but this shall be paid as required duties, and not under the
name of indult. No alcavala shall be paid on sales at Acapulco, but it
shall be paid on goods which shall first be sent to other provinces of
Nueva Espa&ntilde;a. The duties are estimated on the basis of about 17
per cent of the returns on the cargo, and as the king pays &ldquo;the
cost of the building, careening, and repairing of the ships, the pay of
the crews and officers, and the provisions, supplies, and ammunition
needed for each voyage, without receiving more than 44 ducados for each
tonelada of the lading allotted, not only will there remain no profit
to my royal exchequer, but it will be necessary that it supply a
considerable amount in order to maintain and preserve this traffic and
commerce to the natives of Philipinas, which is all the bounty that my
royal munificence can exercise;&rdquo; but if the Manila shippers do
not wish to accept this adjustment of the duties, they can (as before)
pay the exact amount of the duties on each consignment of goods,
without any dispensation or remission. No one to whom space has been
assigned may transfer it to others, save in the case of poor persons
and widows. Any excess of returns over the 1,000,000 pesos shall be
divided among the shippers <i>pro rata</i> on their allotments of space
and valuations of goods at Manila, and they may carry it back in
products and commodities of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href=
"#pb60" name="pb60">60</a>]</span>Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, but not in
money; if the returns fall short of the above sum, the deficiency shall
not be made up, the royal officials being strictly forbidden to allow
any infraction of this rule. Citizens of Nueva Espa&ntilde;a are
prohibited under heavy penalties from participating in this trade as
shippers, of either goods or money. The measures used in regulating the
size of packages shall be those which the Manila shippers have been
accustomed to use, allowance having been made for the difference
between these and the Castilian standards, as decreed in 1702 and 1733.
The committee of distribution at Manila shall be composed of the
following persons: the governor of the islands; the senior auditor of
the Audiencia, or, as his substitute, the auditor next longest in
service; the royal fiscal; the archbishop of Manila, or, as his
substitute, the dean of the cathedral; one of the alcaldes-in-ordinary,
and one of the regidors, of the city of Manila; and one of the eight
arbitrators [<i lang="es">compromissarios</i>] who compose the
commercial body<a class="noteref" id="xd21e876src" href="#xd21e876"
name="xd21e876src">11</a> there&mdash;provided that the regidor and the
arbitrator be chosen in turn, so that this duty shall fall,
successively, on all the members of those respective bodies. Despatches
to this effect were sent to the officials of Mexico, Acapulco and
Filipinas. (The compiler of the <i lang="es">Extracto</i> thinks it
worth while to call attention to the opinion of the royal fiscal of
Mexico, given upon reading this decree, that it was &ldquo;a just one,
and generally advantageous to both commerces.&rdquo;)]</p>

<p class="par first">215&ndash;221. [It was supposed that the foregoing
decree had settled the question of the Manila-Acapulco trade &ldquo;for
many years;&rdquo; but on November 27, 1735, the king sent to his
Council a memorial by Don Joseph Lopez Pintado, consul and deputy of
the commerce of Cadiz, and an informatory report which had been made on
that subject by the lieutenant-general of marine, Don Manuel Lopez
Pintado; on these papers the king asked for the advice and opinions of
the Council. The memorial of Cadiz states the two main points of the
controversy: the first is, whether or not the commerce of Espa&ntilde;a
is injured by the inclusion of the Chinese silks and ribbons in the
cargo of the Manila galleon. Cadiz has long claimed that this was so,
while Manila answered that that trade was necessary for the maintenance
of the islands, &ldquo;and for the propagation of the holy gospel in
them&rdquo;&mdash;which argument, Cadiz says, &ldquo;has always been
the Achilles to oppose the just representations of the commerce of
Espa&ntilde;a.&rdquo; The second point is whether, if the silks are
prohibited to Manila traders, any goods of equal value remain to them
by which they can secure the returns which they claim to need. The
first point is stated as in previous remonstrances, that the Manila
trade in Chinese silks has ruined both the sale and the manufacture of
Spanish silks, especially since the execution of the decree of 1724;
the latter goods can now find no market in America, for the Chinese
silks have made their way not only into Nueva Espa&ntilde;a but into
Peru, the colonies on the northern coast of South <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href="#pb63" name="pb63">63</a>]</span>America,
and all the Windward Islands, &ldquo;nor can their importation be
checked by all the efforts and vigilance of the officials.&rdquo;
Manila has probably abused the royal liberality and has transgressed
the limits of its permission; for the deputies and appraisers there
have valued the goods so low at Manila that at Acapulco they obtain for
them three or four times the amount permitted to them by royal
decree&mdash;for confirmation of which statement is cited the report
made by order of the viceroy of Mexico, on August 23, 1731, by Don
Francisco de Fagoaga, one of the leading merchants of Mexico, who was a
witness of this infraction of law. It is these abuses of the Manila
permission which aroused the viceroy to issue the orders of 1732,
hoping to check the illegal excess therein. Cadiz now offers to
surrender to Manila &ldquo;forever the traffic and transportation of
all the cinnamon, pepper, and cloves which the kingdom of Nueva
Espa&ntilde;a can consume,&rdquo; as also all the trade in chintzes of
various qualities, and in silk raw and spun; in these Manila ought to
find sufficient compensation for giving up the silks, but, even if it
does not, its losses cannot compare with those of Espa&ntilde;a from
the permission given to Manila to trade in those goods, and the
interests of the former ought to be preferred. General Pintado&rsquo;s
informatory report makes a bitter complaint of the frauds and
infringements in the Manila permission to trade.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e933src" href="#xd21e933" name="xd21e933src">12</a> <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href="#pb64" name="pb64">64</a>]</span>He
states that in the first galleon sent to Acapulco under the regulation
of 1726 (which entered Acapulco in the year 1729)<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e938src" href="#xd21e938" name="xd21e938src">13</a> goods were
confiscated by order of the viceroy to the following amount: 285 bales,
49 bags of cinnamon containing 7,105 libras, more than a thousand
arrobas of wax, nineteen chests of silk fabrics, and many other goods.
In the second galleon (that of 1730) were confiscated 319 bales, and
694 piezas of various bulky goods&mdash;cinnamon, wax, pepper, storax,
and porcelain. Cadiz claims that at first (about 1690) the Chinese
goods carried to Nueva Espa&ntilde;a were in so small quantity and so
inferior quality &ldquo;that no one valued such goods; nor did these
injure the commerce of Espa&ntilde;a or its manufactures, until, two
ships of Philipinas having been wrecked, that same viceroy [Conde de
Galvez], as a measure of precaution, despatched General Don
Andr&eacute;s de Arriola with a patache to ascertain the cause for the
delay in the arrival of those ships; and, that commander having
returned to Acapulco in the following year, 1692, with this occasion
the citizens of Mexico promoted the plan of furnishing capital for
another new ship. Various citizens of Mexico, and others from
Per&ugrave;, went thither, and, carrying specimens of our [Spanish]
fabrics, started the establishment [of factories] in Pequin,
Cant&ograve;n, and China; [they also set the Chinese to work] to make
these goods of finer quality, and to manufacture fabrics like those
specimens, and of the same quality. Both qualities were introduced
[into Nueva Espa&ntilde;a] <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href=
"#pb65" name="pb65">65</a>]</span>by that ship and by those which
regularly followed it, in proportion to the amount that they found to
be consumed in Nueva Espa&ntilde;a; and this was considerable, on
account of the fact that four years intervened between the
trading-fleet of Conde de Sanrrami and that of Don Ignacio de Barrios,
and seven years from that of the latter to the fleet of Don Manuel de
Velasco and its return to Espa&ntilde;a. That was the time when the
traders of Philipinas reached the height of their traffic in the silk
fabrics; and, finding in those years that there was no trading-fleet in
Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, they gathered in the rich treasures against which
the consulate and commerce of Andalucia have with reason
remonstrated.&rdquo; Pintado declares that he has been an eyewitness of
these things ever since 1692, and that only during that time has Manila
enjoyed this silk trade which it now claims as belonging to it by free
possession and long usage. Cadiz has frequently protested against the
injury thus caused to the silk industry of Espa&ntilde;a, but has not
before exposed the real condition of affairs; but, &ldquo;even if the
300,000 pesos of the permission which was granted and enjoyed up to the
year 1728 inclusive had all been spent for goods of the silk made in
China, without [the galleon] carrying anything else, at the prices
which they were fairly worth in Manila, and even if twice as much were
furnished at these prices, how was that trade [of Manila] capable of
supplying [with those goods] Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, the Windward Islands
[<i lang="es">Islas de Barlobento</i>], the new kingdom of Granada,
Tierra-Firme, and Per&ugrave;, as we have seen for the last forty
years, when, as those who are intelligent [in these matters]
understand, it is not possible to do so even with two millions&rsquo;
worth of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href="#pb66" name=
"pb66">66</a>]</span>goods of the said class?&rdquo; Manila is accused
of fraud, bad faith, and deceit in the conduct of that trade and in
misrepresenting it to the government; and the royal officials, of
collusion in the illegal trade, and disobedience to the royal decrees
which commanded that the original invoices and sworn statements of
goods should be sent to the Council of the Indias. The only way to
check this procedure is to prohibit entirely to Manila the trade in
Chinese silks; and Cadiz offers to make up this lack by ceding to
Manila the entire spice trade in Nueva Espa&ntilde;a. The following
estimate, based on the amount of spices carried thither by the
trading-fleet, is made of the value of this trade: Of cinnamon, that
country needs 250,000 libras annually, which, estimated at eight silver
reals a libra (although it has been worth at Manila nine reals), would
amount to 250,000 pesos; 100,000 libras of pepper, at one silver real
in Manila, 12,500 pesos; 10,000 libras of cloves, at twelve reals,
15,000 pesos; in all, 277,500 pesos, which is somewhat more than half
of the amount of investment now allowed to Manila. &ldquo;It is certain
that if only the merchants of Philipinas trade in these commodities,
they will advance the price more than 150 per cent, obtaining their
money in Acapulco.&rdquo; Besides the spices, they have permission to
trade in many other commodities which are generally desirable for the
trade with Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, where the consumption of these is
great; and there is more than enough of these to fill out the 500,000
pesos&rsquo; worth of goods allowed them. The result of this
arrangement would be to revive the ruined silk industry of
Espa&ntilde;a (and &ldquo;experience makes it plain to us that there is
no other fabric than silk, of our own weaving, which <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href="#pb67" name="pb67">67</a>]</span>can
produce any profits&rdquo;), besides retaining within the domains of
Espa&ntilde;a the money which now goes to heathens and infidels.
&ldquo;While the commerce of Philipinas shall last, as it is now
carried on, neither the conquests, nor the reduction of the Indians,
will proceed with the increase that people confidently believe; but
rather these will be diminished,&rdquo; because the Spaniards who have
money care only for commerce and not for the propagation of the faith.
This is proved by their neglect of the interests of the natives in
Luz&oacute;n; for &ldquo;we do not see that the Spaniards apply
themselves to what is so much their obligation, since they so loudly
profess it; and consequently they will not re&euml;stablish the
manufactures of cotton fabrics, which can very well be done in those
same islands&mdash;by which industry the natives furnish this product,
and others which are yielded there can be more easily obtained; and in
this case it would be money for those citizens if they would apply
themselves to this enterprise, instead of the commerce which they have
with the Chinese and other infidels.&rdquo; These papers were, as
usual, sent to the fiscal, whose reply came before the Council on
January 8, 1735. He disapproves the proposals of Cadiz, since the
prices of cinnamon and other commodities are liable to fluctuation, and
the amount of profit for Manila would be uncertain and variable;
cinnamon is a bulky product, and the necessary amount could not be
carried in the galleon now assigned to the Manila trade; the merchants
could not be sure of a favorable sale at Acapulco, &ldquo;which at the
fairs is secured by the diversity and abundance of commodities;&rdquo;
moreover, the Dutch, from whom the cinnamon was bought, would raise its
price as <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href="#pb68" name=
"pb68">68</a>]</span>soon as they should learn that the Spaniards of
Filipinas were the only ones to whom was permitted the shipment of
spices to America. If the Manila shippers failed to secure the full
amount for returns, the royal treasury would not receive as much from
customs duties as usual, and must therefore make up the resulting
deficiency in the situado sent to the islands. &ldquo;It would also
follow that even if the merchants of Espa&ntilde;a should religiously
observe the agreement which they propose, of not trading in that
merchandise, the illicit importations into that kingdom [of Nueva
Espa&ntilde;a] would be attempted with even greater activity; and as in
that country there is so general a use of chocolate, in the manufacture
of which would be consumed the greater part of the cinnamon, all that
extensive kingdom would find itself compelled to buy [cinnamon] at one
port only, and through one agency&mdash;being always exposed [to the
danger] that in a year when the Philipinas ship could not make the
voyage (as has happened), or encountered mishaps through accidents
which might occur, that country would experience the deprivation of
this article of sustenance, or at least a great scarcity in a commodity
so generally used, as is well known.&rdquo; The fiscal also reminds the
Council that the trade in spices may be shared with the Royal Company
of England, which is &ldquo;authorized to trade, in its annual ship, in
the goods which it shall choose, in which it could include the
cinnamon, and through this agency introduce it into Mexico; in this it
would seriously injure the commerce of Manila during all the time which
remains for the fulfilment of this agreement, and would be opposed to
the freedom of his Majesty in proroguing it, or making it anew with
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href="#pb69" name=
"pb69">69</a>]</span>some other power. Such action could not be
hindered by the commerce of Espa&ntilde;a, and as little by the Royal
Company of Cadiz, founded by his Majesty on March 29, 1733, which could
introduce this commodity into Mexico.&rdquo; The fiscal recommends that
a junta be convened in Mexico to discuss this subject, and give their
opinions and advice thereon to the Council; and that Manila and Cadiz
be invited to send representatives to this conference. On February 9
the Council agreed to send to the deputies of Filipinas a copy of the
Cadiz memorial, with a statement of the arguments advanced by General
Pintado (but suppressing the name of the author), in order that they
might answer it.]</p>
<p class="par">223&ndash;224. [The Filipinas deputies made answer to
this attack by Cadiz, in a long memorial dated March 30, 1735. Manila
claims to have enjoyed the possession of the silk trade with China from
the discovery of the islands, and that these goods were never excluded
from its trade with Nueva Espa&ntilde;a&mdash;to which country that
trade was not confined until the decrees of 1587&ndash;93&mdash;until
1720, when, at the instance of Andalusia, a prohibition of the Chinese
silks was made, although it lasted only four years. The charges by
Cadiz of frauds in the lading of the Manila galleon have no foundation
in fact; the cited statement by Don Francisco Fagoaga does not appear
among the documents on the subject, and is &ldquo;a fanciful
supposition;&rdquo; and the valuations are made by appraisers appointed
by the governor of Filipinas, under their solemn oath to fulfil their
duties faithfully and well, while the royal fiscal acts as
superintendent of both the valuations and the lading. Manila&rsquo;s
former assertions refuting in detail, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb70" href="#pb70" name="pb70">70</a>]</span>and with citations from
the official records of Manila and Acapulco, the accusations of
infractions and excess of the permission, are repeated here, as also
the statements regarding the Mexican junta of 1732 and the concessions
made to the Company of Philipinas, formed among the Cadiz shippers. The
overstocking of the markets in Nueva Espa&ntilde;a is caused, not by
the silk goods shipped from Manila, but by the enormous quantities of
cloth and stuffs (largely manufactured outside of Espa&ntilde;a) sent
to that country by the Cadiz merchants; they have sent eighteen or
twenty ships<a class="noteref" id="xd21e962src" href="#xd21e962" name=
"xd21e962src">14</a> in each fleet, although <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb71" href="#pb71" name="pb71">71</a>]</span>formerly
there were but ten or twelve&mdash;&ldquo;on account of which excess
his Majesty has finally resolved that only eight shall go in the next
armada, without doubt because of the great outcry regarding this by the
commerce of Mexico.&rdquo; Moreover, those same traders of Cadiz have
secured the concession of fifty toneladas of Chinese silks for each
ship that they <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href="#pb72" name=
"pb72">72</a>]</span>may send out, to be sold in America; the little
that is shipped from Manila ought not to be considered in comparison
with that traffic, and is intended, besides, for the poorer classes,
who cannot afford to buy the more expensive fabrics. If the Western
Indias have been inundated with Chinese silks, it is caused not by the
shipments from Manila, but by the great trade in these goods which is
carried on by the English and Dutch, who have factories and warehouses
in Jamayca and Curazau <i>[i.e.</i>, <span class="corr" id="xd21e981"
title="Source: Cura&ccedil;oa">Cura&ccedil;ao</span>], which they
supply from China and other Oriental countries with fleets of more than
forty ships, and trade those goods in the American islands (as Cadiz is
well aware). As for the offer of Cadiz to yield to Manila all the trade
in spices to Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, that trade has never been prohibited
to Manila nor has it been the exclusive privilege of Cadiz, so the
offer amounts to nothing. Nor has Cadiz any right to dictate to Nueva
Espa&ntilde;a its source of supply for spices, since both the English
and the Cadiz companies have the privilege of trading there in these
goods; moreover, large quantities of pepper are produced in the Mexican
districts of Chiapa and Tabasco; both these causes tend to injure the
sale of spices carried from Manila thither. As these spices (except
pepper, which has but little value in any case) are monopolized by the
Dutch, they are likely to refuse to sell them to the Filipinas
merchants (as has occurred frequently before), because the Dutch need
them for lading their own fleets; or they will raise the prices,
supposing that Filipinas must buy from them. The cinnamon is so bulky
(as it cannot be pressed) that much space on the galleon is thus lost,
as well as by the necessity of carrying two-thirds <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href="#pb73" name="pb73">73</a>]</span>more
ballast than usual, because of the light weight of the cinnamon; and
the voyage of the Manila galleon is incomparably longer, more
difficult, and more perilous than that of the Spanish ships to America.
The amount of spices allotted to the galleon by Pintado would fill all
its available capacity, leaving no room for any other goods; and it
would be impossible for the shippers to secure any profit from such a
cargo&mdash;for which they could not find a market in Nueva
Espa&ntilde;a, for lack of the other goods. Nor would it be possible to
dispose of more than half the amount of pepper and cloves which Cadiz
proposes for them, since that is enough to supply the needs of that
country. In any case, the profit on the spices will be insufficient, if
Manila is restricted to these goods, without the silks, to produce the
amount which those islands need for their support. This is proved by
tabulated statements of the prices, costs, and returns on each one of
the three kinds of spices concerned; these we present here in somewhat
condensed form. A churlo<a class="noteref" id="xd21e986src" href=
"#xd21e986" name="xd21e986src">15</a> of cinnamon, of the measure which
the commerce of Manila orders to be observed, weighs 150 libras gross,
but the net weight is twelve libras less, after deducting the weight of
the coverings and wrappings. The cost in Manila is nine silver reals a
libra; for the space which the churlo occupies is usually paid forty
pesos; for porterage, royal duties, notary&rsquo;s fees, etc., 8 pesos.
On the voyage it loses two per cent in weight, so that but 135 libras
remain for sale; it brings at Acapulco eighteen reals a libra,
amounting <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74" name=
"pb74">74</a>]</span>to 303 pesos, 6 reals. From this must be deducted
the following payments: royal duties, 32 pesos; unlading at Acapulco,
notary&rsquo;s fees, etc., 7 pesos, 2 reals; commission to the agent
for its sale, at five per cent, 15 pesos, 1&frac12; reals; five per
cent royal duties on shipment of the returns to Manila, 12 pesos, 3
reals; two and &frac12; per cent on the net returns, paid to the keeper
of the silver, 5 pesos, 6&frac12; reals. From these figures it appears
that it costs 203 pesos, 2 reals to place the churlo of cinnamon on
shipboard at Manila, and 72 pesos, 5 reals to sell it and return the
money to the shipper there; deducting these expenses from the amount
received for its sale, the profit of the shipper is but 27 pesos, 7
reals, or about 13&frac12; per cent. <i>Pepper</i>: 100,000 libras of
this product make 4,000 arrobas; this quantity (since each pieza is
estimated at six arrobas or 150 libras, without the wrappers) makes 666
piezas. Pepper is sold at Manila at one real a libra, so that the pieza
costs for purchase 18 pesos, 6 reals; it costs 43 pesos more to place
it on the ship, and 18 pesos, 7 reals besides for expenses of sale and
shipment of returns&mdash;in all, 80 pesos, 5 reals. At Acapulco it
would sell at four reals a libra, the pieza, therefore, bringing 75
pesos; the shipper, then, instead of gaining any profit has lost 5
pesos 5 reals by the transaction. <i>Cloves</i>: These are packed in
chests containing 150 libras each; the purchase at Manila costs twelve
reals a libra, so the chest costs 225 pesos. Add to this the cost of
placing it aboard, duties, cost of unlading and sale at Acapulco, and
for the shipment of returns, 146 pesos, 7 reals, and the total cost is
371 pesos, 7 reals. The cloves shrink on the voyage, involving a
wastage of three per cent; at Acapulco <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb75" href="#pb75" name="pb75">75</a>]</span>they sell at three pesos
a libra, and the 145&frac12; libras thus bring 436 pesos, 4
reals&mdash;the net profit to the shipper being 64 pesos, 5 reals, or
about 24 per cent. The prices quoted above are based on those which
have been current in Manila and Acapulco for the past five years. It is
evident, therefore, that the spice trade could not compensate in any
way for the loss of that in silks; nor has Cadiz made allowance for the
possible failure of a galleon to reach Acapulco, which would ruin the
market for the one which should arrive in the following year, since the
spices thus lacking would be supplied through the Atlantic ports of
Nueva Espa&ntilde;a. The customs duties would be much less on a cargo
of spices, and thus impair the royal revenues; for each chest of silk
pays 55 pesos for duties, and each bag of cinnamon only 35. The incomes
of the Spaniards in Filipinas would be so reduced that they could no
longer defend the islands from the Moro pirates, or from the Dutch, who
would thus become masters of them; and the Spanish colony and the
Christian churches formed among the natives would alike be ruined.]</p>
<p class="par">225&ndash;233. [This memorial from the Philipinas
deputies was communicated to the deputy from the commercial interests
of Espa&ntilde;a, Joseph Lopez Pintado, on March 31, 1735; and on the
first of June following he presented another in reply, accompanied by
various illustrative documents. The former arguments are repeated, but
various interesting data are adduced in their support. Pintado states
that the looms for making silk fabrics in Espa&ntilde;a numbered more
than 70,000 in the days when that industry flourished there. Nueva
Espa&ntilde;a was forbidden to cultivate the vine and the olive, in
order <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="#pb76" name=
"pb76">76</a>]</span>to protect those industries in Espa&ntilde;a. The
commerce of Manila in Chinese silks has ruined the silk manufacture not
only in Espa&ntilde;a but in Mexico, where formerly was worked up the
raw silk carried by the Manila galleon. Cadiz claims that the decree of
April 8, 1734, was obtained on the strength of the representations made
by the Manila deputies, without giving Cadiz any opportunity for
remonstrance; Abreu furnishes at this point a marginal note to explain
this, saying that the king asked the Council of the Indias to report on
the matter as quickly as possible, and that the action which he wished
to take brought the question back to the status which it had on
previous occasions of this sort, when the commerce of Andalusia had had
a full hearing; they had therefore considered it unnecessary to hear
its arguments again. The enactments of 1593 are cited to show that not
until then was the commerce of Manila restricted, and that because it
was injuring that of Espa&ntilde;a; but this and succeeding laws show
that it was the royal intention to allow Manila sufficient trade to
provide for its needs and support. Moreover, after the islands were
conquered a large territory was allotted to Manila (as to other Spanish
colonies) for its support; and in its early history these lands
produced abundantly for the maintenance of the inhabitants. Besides
these, the cotton fabrics made by the natives were more than enough to
supply the islands, and became the basis of the exchange and barter
trade with China. Manila ought to return to these industries for its
support, and has no right to expect that it be supported without them.
All the realms of Espa&ntilde;a are under obligation to support the
crown; but Manila asks <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77"
name="pb77">77</a>]</span>the crown to support it, at the expense of
great injury to the interests of Espa&ntilde;a itself. The citizens of
Manila have yielded to idleness and sloth, and have allowed the
idolatrous Sangleys to monopolize and manage the industries and even
the commerce of the islands. Some of the mestizos had erected looms for
the manufacture of the finer kinds of cotton fabrics, but the Sangleys
succeeded in breaking up this enterprise. A section of the memorial is
devoted to proving that the permission to Manila to trade in Chinese
silks has not been and is not of use for the increase and propagation
of the Catholic faith in those regions, which has flourished without
Manila and its commerce; on the other hand, the success and profits of
that commerce have been caused largely by the work of the missionaries,
especially in China. As for the Chinese who are converted at Manila
(drawn thither by the opportunity for trade), they usually become
Christians for selfish and worldly ends, and soon relapse into their
former heathenism. They even have a proverb: &ldquo;In Manila, [do] as
in Manila; in China, [do] as in China.&rdquo; Their infidelity and
atheism have a bad influence on the Indian converts, who learn many
evil things from the Chinese, as also do the converts in China itself;
and the citizens of Manila are reproached for their familiar relations
with those infidels. They have also allowed the Chinese to get control
of affairs and commerce in Manila, and the latter are living on their
blood. In Espa&ntilde;a, both canon and civil law prohibit intercourse
with Mahometans and idolaters, and it is not long since the Moriscos
were expelled from that country&mdash;notwithstanding &ldquo;the great
products of their industry, the tributes which <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href="#pb78" name="pb78">78</a>]</span>they
paid into the royal treasury, the commerce of the province [of
Andalusia] which through them was greater than that of the other
realms, and even (which is more important) their being the sheep [of
the Church], which Manila says ought to be sought out and preserved;
for, as it had been found impossible to secure the purity of religion
by the means which the law set forth, it was necessary, in view of the
duty of preserving and maintaining the holy Catholic faith in the
kingdom in quiet, peace, and security, to expel and cast out those
people. Accordingly, in order to preserve the faith in Philipinas,
which is a matter that should receive careful attention, the
prohibition of their commerce [with the Chinese] is necessary, which is
of even less estimation than that of those expelled Moriscoes.&rdquo;
In another section, Cadiz reminds the king that in the compilation of
the statutes of the realm provision is made that no decree or ordinance
which is contrary to law and right, or which is injurious to certain
regions, shall have force; and this should apply to the decree of 1734
permitting to Manila the commerce in silks, since that has deprived the
Spanish traders of their rights and privileges in the results of their
commerce, and has ruined the silk industry in that country. Thus is
greatly injured the prosperity of the provinces in which it was
exercised; and this reacts on the entire kingdom of Espa&ntilde;a,
reducing so many artisans to poverty, causing them to abandon their
families or their native places, and bringing many to idleness and
crime. Cadiz again alleges the frauds in the Manila commerce, declaring
that the goods sent to Acapulco are appraised at less than the fourth
of their current value in Manila, and are sold <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href="#pb79" name="pb79">79</a>]</span>at 100
per cent advance on that actual value; and that these illegal acts are
promoted by the merchants of Mexico, in collusion with those of
Manila&mdash;all of which may be proved by the documents in the
archives of the Council of the Indias. This trade of Manila in silks
from China enriches a small class of wealthy merchants (in both Manila
and Mexico), the only ones who have the wealth to engage in and profit
by it&mdash;and this at the expense of the poor and those who have but
moderate funds, by absorbing the opportunities and profits in which the
latter ought by right to have a share. The Chinese goods, moreover, are
of poor and flimsy quality, and last only one-fourth to one-half the
time that the Spanish fabrics do. Cadiz supports its arguments by many
citations from the laws of the realm; among these are prohibitions
against exporting the products or commodities of one province or city
to another&mdash;as, no salt, wine, must, or vinegar might enter
Castilla from Arag&oacute;n or Navarra; and the silk of Calabria and
Napoles must not be imported into the cities of Segovia, Zamora,
Salamanca, Cordova, and Cuenca&mdash;although all these were parts of
the Spanish empire. In line with these is the desired prohibition of
the silk trade to Manila, especially since that trade is so injurious
to the commerce and industry of the mother-country. In that case Manila
should have (by another law cited) an equivalent benefit; and Cadiz has
already proposed this, in the spice trade&mdash;to which it has a
right, but is willing to cede it to Manila. The arguments brought
forward by Manila as to the consumption of spice in Nueva
Espa&ntilde;a, the bulky character of that merchandise, the costs of
transportation and sale, duties, etc., are met <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80" name="pb80">80</a>]</span>by Cadiz
with others to refute or weaken the former. The Manila galleon brought
to Acapulco in 1729 cinnamon to the amount of 99,233 libras, and in the
following year 167,100 libras. The fleets from Espa&ntilde;a carried
thither the following cargoes of that spice: In 1723, 105,201 libras;
in 1725, 143,629 libras; in 1729, 225,012 libras; in 1732, 182,163
libras. Add to this the amounts which the Manila galleons transport;
those which are carried in pack-cloth bales [<i lang=
"es">arpiller&iacute;a</i>] (subject to <i>palm&eacute;o</i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1035src" href="#xd21e1035" name=
"xd21e1035src">16</a>), in order to gain the benefit of the [reduced?]
freight charges; and, besides, those which the licensed ship from
Inglaterra conveys (of which no definite calculation can be made): it
is morally certain that the annual consumption of Nueva Espa&ntilde;a
will amount to and even exceed the 250,000 libras. Even if it should
fall below that, there are other facts to be considered. It is true
that &ldquo;when the traders from Espa&ntilde;a, England, and Filipinas
all come at the same time&mdash;that is, in the month of March, when
the fairs are held (for the first two nations, at Xalapa; and for the
last, at Acapulco)&mdash;the price is usually broken to 18 reals of
silver a libra, as the deputies state; but they omit what is more
worthy of consideration. This is, that in the intermediate years
between the trading-fleets, and according to the circumstances of the
times, the price of this commodity rises to so excessive a degree that,
from the year 1706 to that of 1709, on account of the wars in Europa
and the failure of fleets to go to Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, a libra of
cinnamon was maintained at twelve to thirteen pesos, this great profit
being secured by the ships from <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb81"
href="#pb81" name="pb81">81</a>]</span>Philipinas, which came in those
years to Acapulco. And from the year 1725 to that of 1730 (at which
time the petitioner [<i>i.e.</i>, Pintado] was in Mexico) I knew from
experience that in the ship which came in the year 1728 the Philipinos
sold the cinnamon at five pesos a libra; and those who did not return
in the galleon, and conveyed to Mexico some quantities of the cinnamon,
succeeded in selling it at eight to nine pesos. In the year 1729, it
was disposed of in Acapulco at thirty silver reals [or 3&frac34;
pesos]. This is what occurs, and always will occur, on the aforesaid
occasions of interval [between fleets], and, too, [it occurred] when
the trade was carried on by both parties (which is what deprives
commodities of value, through being handled by many persons); the
exclusive control [of this spice], then, remaining in the [hands of
the] Philipinos, from their being the only ones who transport it, the
reputation and value which they can give it, and the lucrative profits
which (without contest) they will obtain, are not doubtful.&rdquo; The
objections raised by Manila in regard to expected competition are not
well founded: the Company of Philipinas is in an inactive condition,
and its directors have apparently abandoned their scheme, but in any
case Cadiz would feel responsible for not allowing that company to
injure Manila&rsquo;s spice trade; and, as for the English ship, the
king can persuade or prevent its owners from including spices in their
cargoes. The prices of spice charged to Manila by the Dutch are much
more likely to fall than to rise, when Manila has the exclusive control
of that trade. Cadiz asserts that the costs of trade enumerated by
Manila are too large, and modifies them thus: Cinnamon (of which, as
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82" name=
"pb82">82</a>]</span>in all other commodities, there are three
grades&mdash;poor, medium, and excellent) ought to cost but 8 reals at
Manila. The duties paid there, on the basis of 44 ducados (of 11 reals
each) a tonelada, should be only 13 pesos a churlo, according to its
measurement in palmos; and the other expenses of placing it on board
amount to 3 pesos&mdash;so that it costs only 154 pesos a sack to
convey the cinnamon to Acapulco, instead of 203, as Manila claims. The
profit, therefore, amounts to 77 pesos, 1 real, which is equal to 50
per cent, instead of 13. In the same way Cadiz reckons the gain on
pepper at 96 per cent, and on cloves at 43 per cent, against
Manila&rsquo;s estimate of a loss on pepper and a gain of 24 per cent
on cloves. It must be noted, too, that Manila is not satisfied with
less than 100 per cent gain, while the Spanish traders are hardly able
to make good the principal cost of their wares. The amount of ballast
required for a light cargo is also overstated; this matter has been
duly investigated by the officials of the India House at Cadiz, and it
appears that the maximum amount of ballast for a ship of 1,000
toneladas, of the usual construction and of American timbers, is 333
toneladas for a cargo of light goods (such as cinnamon and bales of
cloth). The Philipinas ship carries stone for ballast; the 333
toneladas of this, each weighing twenty quintals, are equivalent (by
cubic measure) to 117 toneladas of the vessel&rsquo;s lading-space or
capacity, which leaves 883 toneladas of space in the hold for the
cargo. To augment the above amount of ballast would too greatly reduce
the cargo, and even the necessary supplies for the voyage. Cadiz
criticises the construction of the Manila galleons, especially as they
are evidently built <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83"
name="pb83">83</a>]</span>so as to carry a larger cargo than that which
is allowed by the permission&mdash;as is confirmed by the large amounts
of property that have been confiscated at Acapulco. The
&ldquo;elephant&rdquo; lienzos may be estimated to fill 800 bales, each
containing 20 piezas, and each pieza being valued at 3 pesos; and the
cotton stuffs and raw silk, etc., 1,512 bales, each worth at least 125
pesos. These cotton stuffs, when fine, are handsome, and find a large
demand and sale in Nueva Espa&ntilde;a; moreover, the raw silk imported
into that country is worked up in Mexico, and is an important article
of commerce. When the importation of Chinese silks is prohibited there,
&ldquo;the manufactories which had begun to be established in Mexico
will be protected; in these many persons were occupied, and were
supported by working floss and twisted silk into fringes
[<i>galon</i>], and into the fabrics which were used in Mexico,
produced by those factories.&rdquo; The &ldquo;elephant&rdquo; stuffs,
&ldquo;being equivalent to Rouen linen, and conveniently supplied, are
purchased in Nueva Espa&ntilde;a not only to be used as white goods,
but they are dyed for linings and other purposes.&rdquo; The extent of
their consumption is shown by the quantities of them that the Manila
galleon brings to Nueva Espa&ntilde;a: 3,117 bales in 1729, and 2,432
in 1730; but even these large importations did not overstock the market
there. The customs duties are not diminished, as Manila claims, by the
prohibition of Chinese silks; the cargo proposed by Cadiz would yield
the regular amount of these duties, amounting to 17 per cent of the
returns, as follows: on 168 sacks of cinnamon, at 32 pesos, they amount
to 54,016 pesos; on 2,312 bales of cotton stuffs, etc., at 30 pesos
each, 69,360 pesos; the five per cent exacted on the shipment of the
silver <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84" name=
"pb84">84</a>]</span>for returns, figured only on a return of 900,000
pesos, 45,000 pesos. This leaves a balance of only 1,624 pesos to be
levied on the wax, pepper, and other miscellaneous wares of the cargo,
to fill out the 17 per cent demanded by the crown. Manila has omitted
to include any estimate of the import duties which would be collected
in that city on the cinnamon which Cadiz desires it to handle; these
would certainly indemnify Manila for the losses incurred by the lack of
the Chinese silks. Among the papers accompanying this memorial are
official certificates of the amounts of spice carried to Nueva
Espa&ntilde;a by the trading-fleets from Cadiz during 1723&ndash;32;
the quantity of cinnamon in each has been already mentioned, cloves
were not included in any of their cargoes, and pepper diminished from
54,804 libras in 1723 to none in 1732. Another document is the report
of an investigation made at Cadiz as to the measures of bales and
chests and of the <i lang="es">churlo</i> in which the cinnamon is
transported; this last was found to measure 30 cubic palmos outside the
vessel&rsquo;s hold, but 38 palmos when within it. <i lang=
"es">Arqu&eacute;o</i> is defined as &ldquo;the computation or estimate
which is made of the bulk of the lading which the ship contains in its
hold; this burden was measured by toneladas, each one of which
contained 8 cubic codos, and each codo consisted of 33 dedos of the 48
into which the Castilian vara (which is commonly called &lsquo;the vara
of measure&rsquo;) was divided. The tonelada, having as its [cubic]
root two codos, or 66 dedos, contains 287,496 cubic dedos; dividing
this number by 1,728, the number of cubic dedos in a cubic palmo, or
quarter of a vara, each tonelada of <i lang="es">arqu&eacute;o</i> is
equivalent to 166&#8540; cubic palmos; from this it is deduced
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85" name=
"pb85">85</a>]</span>that if the ship is one of 1,000 toneladas, it
will contain 166,375 cubic palmos, and in the same ratio for any other
tonnage. As for the regulation of the spaces between decks [<i lang=
"es">entrepuentes</i>] by the capacity of their storerooms, no general
rule could be given, on account of the great irregularity which was
observed in them; for this matter was at the discretion of the
shipbuilders, and according to the object for which the vessel was
built.&rdquo;]</p>
<p class="par">237&ndash;241. [This memorial having been sent to the
fiscal, he replied (November 10, 1735) that the proposal of Cadiz was
not a fair one; for the purchase of 250,000 libras of cinnamon, and the
costs of placing that amount in the Acapulco market, would amount, even
at Cadiz&rsquo;s own figures, to an investment of 277,008 pesos, and at
Manila&rsquo;s to 331,024 pesos, while Cadiz had assumed but 250,000 as
the amount to be put into cinnamon by Manila. The result would be that
Manila either would not transport all that quantity to Nueva
Espa&ntilde;a, or would lose part of the profit on its shipment. The
profits at Acapulco are not sufficient, on either class of commodities
proposed by Cadiz, to yield the amount which is permitted to Manila as
returns on its shipments. The spices can never be an equivalent (as
Cadiz would claim) for the Chinese silks; for a tonelada of cinnamon,
which space is occupied with only 600 libras, is worth at Manila 600
pesos, and a tonelada of silk goods is worth 4,000 pesos, if not more.
The amount of cinnamon proposed by Cadiz would occupy 416&#8532;
toneladas, and the ballast (on a galleon of 900 toneladas) 300 more;
this would leave for the cotton stuffs, etc. (all of which are bulky
goods) only 183&#8531; toneladas, with which it <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href="#pb86" name="pb86">86</a>]</span>would be
impossible to complete the 250,000 pesos of investment allowed to
Manila. But when they are allowed to carry Chinese silks, these are
contained in 500 piezas, which occupy but 62&frac12; toneladas, each
tonelada worth 4,000 pesos; and there remain to the shippers 3,500
piezas for the cheaper and bulky goods. The fiscal declares that even
if the spices were an equivalent in value for the silk trade, the
proposed commerce in them would be injurious to all parties concerned.
&ldquo;The losses to the royal exchequer would consist in the less
value of the duties which the 250,000 libras of cinnamon would
contribute [to it] in Espa&ntilde;a than in Acapulco. For in that port
they would amount, as the fiscal has been informed, to 21,944 pesos;
and in Cadiz the import duties alone for the millon and alcavala pay 34
pesos a quintal of 100 libras, and, with those of export for the Indias
(which, according to plan, are 20 pesos a quintal), would amount to
160,000 pesos. To this sum ought to be added at least 50 per cent for
the greater value of money in Cadiz, where his Majesty will receive it
[for the duties] immediately, than in the Indias; and with all these
the royal exchequer will be defrauded to the extent of 218,056
pesos.&rdquo; The price of cinnamon will rise, when only the amount
actually needed is sold; and this will be a burden on the general
public. If the spice trade be limited to the Philippine merchants,
there is nothing to hinder those of Mexico from &ldquo;cornering&rdquo;
the market, and selling such quantities only as they please, at
enormous prices; moreover, the failure of the annual shipment from
Manila (which is possible in any year) would cause great scarcity of
this product throughout the great kingdom of Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, and
this would be a serious injury to its citizens&mdash;&ldquo;especially
in an article <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87" name=
"pb87">87</a>]</span>[like this], for the lack of which there is no
equivalent which can make it good; nor is its expenditure limited by
the variety of uses [to which it can be put], or by the frequent
inconstancy of fashions, like other merchandise, but depends on a
certain and assured consumption.&rdquo; This compulsory spice trade
would injure Manila itself not only for the reasons already cited, but
because it is possible that the Dutch would refuse to sell the cinnamon
to the Philippine shippers; and then, with the Chinese silks cut off
from them, they would find it impossible to continue their commerce
with Nueva Espa&ntilde;a. In any case, the Dutch would have it in their
power to demand whatever price they might choose to place on their
commodities; and the interruption of that traffic for two or three
years would not hurt the Dutch, for they could sell it to European
traders and be sure of their profits; but the injurious effects of such
proceeding would react on the Manila merchants, the people of Nueva
Espa&ntilde;a, and the income of the Spanish treasury. If at any time
cinnamon should bring in Nueva Espa&ntilde;a the enormous prices which
Cadiz has previously quoted, that would not help Manila, since its
returns are limited to 1,000,000 pesos; the unusual profits would only
benefit the Mexican traders who had bought the spice by wholesale at
Acapulco. The assertion of Cadiz that the Manila merchants gain on the
cinnamon 150 per cent at Acapulco does not count, for it entirely
ignores the costs and expenses which, as has been demonstrated, reduce
their net gain to 50 per cent. For all these reasons, the fiscal
declines to approve the proposals of Cadiz. In view of this reply, the
Council agreed (November 16) to call for a summary view of the whole
question, with all the documents concerned. At this point, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb88" href="#pb88" name=
"pb88">88</a>]</span>information was received from Cadiz that the fleet
which had just arrived had brought a sack of cinnamon as a specimen of
that which was produced in the Philippine Islands, and that the quality
of this surpassed that of the cinnamon brought from the Dutch colonies.
On January 21, 1736, the deputies from Filipinas presented a new but
brief memorial, refuting some arguments by Cadiz in regard to the
proposed substitution of the spice trade for that in silks, and for
this purpose citing a royal decree of 1638 in their favor, which Cadiz
had declared not to be in the <i lang="es">Recopilaci&oacute;n</i> of
the laws, and proving, by duly attested declarations, that the said
decree existed in the Manila archives. At the end of these appears a
final paragraph by Abreu, the compiler of the <i lang=
"es">Extracto</i>: &ldquo;All that is thus far set forth is what up to
the present time has been done and appears in the <i lang=
"es">Expediente</i> of the important and long-standing negotiation in

according to the acts, royal decrees, memorials, and other documents
furnished to us by the office of the secretary for Nueva Espa&ntilde;a,
in order that this Summary [<i lang="es">Extracto</i>] might be drawn

the New World was subjected to the alcavala. This is a tax levied only
upon whatever is sold at wholesale, and does not extend to the articles
for daily consumption; it is derived originally from the Moors. The
Spaniards adopted it in 1341, and established it at the rate of five
per cent. It was finally placed at ten, and forced up even to fourteen
per cent; but in 1750 arrangements were made which brought the rate
back to what it was at first. Philip II, after the disastrous end of
that fleet so well known under the pompous title of
&lsquo;invincible,&rsquo; in 1591 resolved, on account of his needs, to
exact this aid from all his possessions in America. At the outset, it
was only two per cent; in 1627, it rose to four.&rdquo; (Raynal,

new despatch threw into consternation the commercial interests
here.&rdquo; The governor asked advice from the fiscal, who, as the
order came not as a formal royal decree, thought that it might be
regarded as only the viceroy&rsquo;s expression of opinion, and the
governor might take such measures as he deemed best. The citizens were
informed of the viceroy&rsquo;s requirement, and asked the governor to
investigate the foreign trade then carried on at Canton&mdash;saying
that they were informed that &ldquo;toward the end of the preceding
year, 1731, various large vessels&mdash;French, English, and those
belonging to the companies of Olanda and Ostende&mdash;entered the port
of Canton in China with more than three millions in wealth, in silver
and other commodities; and the presumption was that those goods [which
they bought] could have no other destination than the Americas, to be
introduced there by way of the Northern Sea [<i>i.e.</i>, Atlantic
Ocean].&rdquo; Such investigation was accordingly made by official
authority, and thirteen witnesses were examined&mdash;Armenians,
French, and Portuguese. These agreed in their testimony, as
eyewitnesses, that &ldquo;in the city of Canton, in the kingdom of
China, the French had maintained a factory for the space of seven
years, as also had the English during two years; but these had been
suppressed in the preceding year of 31 by the governor of Canton, on
account of a controversy which the French and English had with the
Chinese traders. Nevertheless, many of their ships, and [others] from
Europa, remained there; and accordingly the witnesses had seen in the
preceding year two French ships, four English, three Dutch, and one
from Denmark, all of great burden and capacity, which carried thither a
great amount of wealth in silver of Mexican and Peruvian coinage, and
some small quantity in bullion. With this the foreigners bought
silks&mdash;raw, in bundles, <i lang="es">qui&ntilde;a</i>, and others
in colors, and woven fabrics&mdash;gold bullion, porcelain, and tea;
and the witnesses were certain that they bought these commodities for
the commerce with Per&ugrave; and other parts of the Indias, as was
evident from the money [that they used], and as the witnesses knew by
having heard it from the foreigners themselves.&rdquo; The citizens
also represented to the governor their objections to the proposed
restriction on their commerce; they declared that it was not the
Acapulco trade which was injuring that of Spain in America, as Cadiz
had claimed, but the importation of Chinese goods by the European
countries&mdash;fifteen or more ships at a time, with more than four
millions of pesos, buying these at Canton, &ldquo;with no other object
than to introduce these into the Americas by the agency of the
Spaniards themselves.&rdquo; &ldquo;The truth was, that this complaint
did not begin until the foreign ships found their way to Canton.&rdquo;
The Spanish merchants ought not to complain of the small quantity of
Chinese silk traded by Manila, when they themselves formed the channel
for the far greater commerce therein of the other European nations,
&ldquo;in which the Chinese goods, made in imitation of the European
goods, and folded double like them, occupy the same place.&rdquo;
Moreover, the money returned to the Filipinas Islands did not all go,
as Cadiz claimed, to foreign countries; but the greater part of it was
invested in the <i lang="es">obras pias</i>, and in the fortunes of the
citizens. It must also be noted that the Chinese champans carried home
considerable cargoes of sibucao, sugar, and other products of the
islands, in exchange for their stuffs. The royal officials at Manila,
consulted by the governor, declared that the customs and other duties
on the commerce would be greatly diminished by the prohibition of
Chinese silks to the Acapulco trade&mdash;to the extent of more than
31,000 pesos a year, as was the case in the years 1719 and 1720, when
the champans failed to arrive at Manila; besides which, the treasury
lost 12,000 pesos, in the license-fees paid by the Chinese merchants
who came to reside in the islands and sell their wares, and 6,000 more
from other incomes dependent on the Chinese. The governor called
together a conference of the religious superiors and the leading
citizens; at which the matter was discussed pro and con; the sense of
the meeting was expressed by the Dominican Fray Juan de Arrechedera,
commissary of the Inquisition, who was asked to place his opinion in
writing, and this was signed by those present, and attested by the
governor, as president of the assembly. Arrechedera took the ground
that the viceroy&rsquo;s notification was not a formal royal decree;
that if carried out it would mean the ruin of the islands, which surely
the king could not intend or mean; that the matter should properly be
decided by the king himself, after Manila had opportunity to be heard
before him; and the viceroy could only regulate the commerce according
to the royal orders, and had no authority to change the present
conditions without those orders. The Jesuit provincial did not sign
this opinion, but rendered his own separately, warning the Manila
merchants that the viceroy might be offended at their attitude, and
confiscate their goods if they did not obey him. The royal officials
advised the governor to allow the silks to be sent to Acapulco, and
meanwhile to secure the good-will of the viceroy for intercession with
the king in Manila&rsquo;s behalf. The matter was finally settled,
however, by the royal decree of 1734, obtained through the efforts of
the Manila agents at the court, which revoked the viceroy&rsquo;s
orders and permitted the silk trade to continue. (Concepci&oacute;n.

&ldquo;Although the silks which Spain furnishes are in general very
choice, those of Valencia are far superior [to the rest]; and both are
suitable for all uses. Their only defect is that they are a little too
oily, which causes much difficulty in dyeing them.&rdquo; &ldquo;The
diversity of silks which Europe produces has not enabled us to dispense
with that from China. Although in general it may be of heavy quality
and uneven staple, it will always be in demand for its
whiteness.&rdquo; &ldquo;The whiteness of the Chinese silk, to which
nothing else can be compared, renders it the only suitable kind for the
manufacture of blondes and gauzes. The efforts that have been made to
substitute our silks for it in the manufacture of blondes have always
been fruitless, although not only dressed but undressed silks have been
tried for this purpose; but the results have been somewhat less
unsatisfactory in regard to gauzes.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par footnote">&ldquo;In the last century, the Europeans
brought from China very little [raw] silk; ours was sufficiently good
for the black or colored gauzes, and for the catgut gauzes
[<i>marlis</i>] which then were worn. The taste which has prevailed
during the last forty years (and more generally during the last
twenty-five) for white gauzes and for blondes has gradually increased
the consumption of this Oriental product; the amount of this rose in
modern times to eighty thousand pounds a year, of which France always
used nearly three-fourths; and this importation has so greatly
increased that in 1766 the English alone took a hundred and four
thousand-weight of it. As the gauzes and blondes could not consume that
amount, the manufacturers used part of it in making watered silks
[<i lang="fr">moires</i>] and hose.... Besides this silk of unique
whiteness&mdash;which is chiefly produced in the province of
Tche-Kiang, and which we know in Europe under the name of Nankin silk,
from the place, where it is especially made&mdash;China produces
ordinary silks, which we call Canton silks. As these are suitable for
only the wefts of some silk fabrics, and are as expensive as those of
Europe which serve for the same uses, very little of them is imported;
and what the English and Dutch carry away of this Canton silk does not
exceed five or six thousand-weight.&rdquo; (Raynal, <i lang=
"fr">&Eacute;tablissemens et commerce des Europ&eacute;ens</i>, i, pp.
660&ndash;662.)</p>
<p class="par footnote">&ldquo;The Chinese are no less skilful in
working up their silks than in producing them; but this praise ought
not to extend to those of their stuffs in which gold and silver are
woven. Their manufacturers have never known how to draw these metals
into thread, and their ingenuity is always confined to rolling their
silks in gilded papers, or in pasting [<i lang="fr">appliquer</i>] the
stuffs to those same papers; both methods are equally faulty.&rdquo;

of the atlas volume of Raynal&rsquo;s <i lang="fr">Histoire ... des
&eacute;tablissemens et du commerce des Europ&eacute;ens</i> (ed. of
1780, Geneva) are various supplementary sheets, containing tabulated
summaries of the kinds and amounts of trade carried on by the leading
European nations with their colonial possessions, chiefly those of
America; from some of these we abstract items of interest which have
some relation to the scope of our work. The first of these shows the
amount and value of the commerce of the Company of Holland in the East
Indies from 1720 to 1729 inclusive. In these ten years they sent out an
average of 37 or 38 ships each year, manned by about 7,000 men; of
these, 30 returned to Europe. The merchandise sold by the company
amounted, in round numbers, to an average of 18,859,000 florins yearly,
and the dividends distributed among the partners to 23&#8535; per cent
(ranging, in different years, from 12&frac12; to 40 per cent); the
amount of money sent to the Cape of Good Hope and to the Asian Islands
averaged 6,560,000 florins. The average sales of spices yearly were as
follows: Pepper, 4,500,000 pounds, at 11 sols, 2,475,000 florins;
cinnamon, 400,000 pounds, at 5&frac34; florins, 2,300,000 florins;
cloves, 400,000 pounds, at 4&frac14; florins, 1,700,000 florins;
nutmegs, 250,000 pounds, at 3&frac34; florins, 937,500 florins; mace,
90,000 pounds, at 6&frac12; florins, 585,000 florins&mdash;a total of
7,997,500 florins. The original capital of the Dutch East India Company
was 6,459,840 florins; about 57 per cent of this was held in Amsterdam,
and about 21 per cent in the province of Zeeland. The number of shares
was 2,153, each of 3,000 florins. During the period 1605 to 1777, the
dividends annually distributed ranged usually from 12&frac12; to 40 per
cent; in the following years they exceeded the latter rate&mdash;being
in 1606, 75 per cent; in 1610, 50; in 1612, 57&frac12;; in 1615,
42&frac12;; in 1616, 62&frac12;; in 1671, 45 and 15. During
1771&ndash;77, they were uniformly 12&frac12; per cent. These were paid
usually in money; sometimes, in the earlier years, in cloves; and, in
1673, 1679, and 1697, in bonds or in contracts. In the period
1723&ndash;74, the prices of shares ranged from 788 per cent (in 1733)
to 314 (in 1771).</p>
<p class="par footnote">Another table shows similar figures for the
years 1679 to 1774&mdash;apparently for the new organization of the
company in 1674. The capital is stated at 8,071,135 florins; there were
1,345 shares, of 6,000 florins each. The dividends, during the above
period, ranged from 10 per cent to nothing, the yearly average being
1&ndash;21/32 per cent; neither these figures nor the prices of shares
agree with those of the first table, but the reason for the discrepancy
is not obvious.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

1733 Sevilla and Cadiz &ldquo;both imagined (and it is rather
surprising that this had not been sooner evident) that it would be an
advantage to Spain to take part directly in the commerce of Asia, and
that the possessions which it had in that part of the world would be
the center of the operations which it would conduct there. In vain was
the objection made against them that, as India furnished silk and
cotton fabrics that were superior to those of Europe in their finish,
in their colors, and (above all) in their cheapness, the national
manufacturers could not support competition with those goods, and would
infallibly be ruined. This objection, which might have some weight
among certain peoples, seemed to them utterly frivolous, in the
position in which their country stood. As a fact, the Spaniards use for
both their clothing and their furniture foreign stuffs and cloths; and
these continual needs necessarily increase the industry, the wealth,
the population, and the strength of their neighbors&mdash;who misuse
these advantages, in order to keep in dependence the very nation which
obtains these for them. Would not Spain behave with more wisdom and
dignity if she would adopt the manufactures of the Indias? Resides the
economy and satisfaction which she would find therein, she would
succeed in diminishing a preponderance [of other nations] of which she
will be, sooner or later, the victim.&rdquo; (Raynal, <i lang=

made a promising beginning in the Oriental trade; but the opposition of
the Dutch and Portuguese, already intrenched therein, was so great and
persistent that the English company&mdash;which was compelled to
encounter also, in turn, competition from other English traders,
hindrances arising from the duplicity and avarice of Charles II of
England, losses arising from the civil war in that country, hostilities
(originating from the greed and treachery of one of the company&rsquo;s
own directors) with the Mogul emperor Aurungzebe, and the capture of
<span class="corr" id="xd21e763" title="Source: may">many</span>
English trading vessels by French privateers&mdash;was several times
almost ruined, and all English commercial prestige in the East was
greatly injured. Finally, in 1702, the two rival East India companies
in England united their funds and enterprises, and thereafter the
affairs of the new organization prospered, in the main; and in 1763 the
French were driven out of Asia, leaving the English masters of both
political and commercial interests in India. In 1774 the latter drove
out the Mahrattas from Salsette Island, and founded Bombay, which,
although at first an insalubrious locality, on account of its fine
harbor soon became the emporium of English commerce and center of that

the <i>fardo</i> was 1&#8531; varas long, &frac34; vara high, and
&frac34; vara less one <i>pulgada</i> (nearly one English inch) wide;
but for a long time previous to 1726 the bale of this size had not been
used, because it became necessary to break it open at Acapulco, in
order to transfer the goods from the ship to the land, and it was
replaced by the half-bale and half-chest, in order not to break open
the package before selling it or transporting it across the country.
These smaller packages were then called &ldquo;bales&rdquo; and
&ldquo;chests&rdquo; (<i>fardos</i> and <i>caxones</i>); their
dimensions are given in the decree of 1726 (fol. 118 verso of <i lang=

of the bureau of accounts in Mexico, to the viceroy, on March 6, 1730.

&ldquo;With this, it may be said, finally came to an end the celebrated
controversies which so persistently and for so long a time were waged
by the merchants of Cadiz against the commerce of Filipinas, the
standard of the [permission of] 500,000 dollars [<i lang=
"es">duros</i>] remaining permanent until the emancipation of the
Americas [from Spanish rule] put an end to that traffic. It had the
same effect on all the restrictions which for the space of almost three
centuries had weighed down the Filipino commerce&mdash;for even in the
year 1810 (as Comyn tells us in his <i lang="es">Estado de las islas
Filipinas</i>, speaking of the Acapulco galleon) only one ship,
commanded by an officer of the navy, could make these expeditions, once
a year; and in order to share in that commerce a merchant must have a
vote in the consulate, which presupposed property to the amount of
8,000 dollars and several years of residence in the country. He was
[also] obliged to contribute, in the same proportion as the other
shippers, to the allowance of 15,000 or 20,000 dollars made to the
commandant of the galleon, besides paying 25 to 40 per cent for freight
charges, according to circumstances. [Meanwhile,] the shippers were not
able to make any examination of the condition of the ships in which
they risked a great part of their fortunes; and there were many other
impediments, which now we would suppose could not possibly have ever
existed, if we were not so habituated to stupid proceedings of this
sort.&rdquo; (Azcarraga y Palmero, <i lang="es">Libertad de
comercio</i>, pp. 64, 65.)</p>
<p class="par footnote">When the galleon of Acapulco ceased its
voyages&mdash;the last one sailed from Manila in 1811, and returned
from Acapulco in 1815&mdash;the commerce fell into the hands of
individuals, to whom in 1820 permission was granted to export
merchandise from Filipinas to the value of 750,000 pesos a year; and
their voyages were extended from Acapulco to San Blas, Guayaquil, and
Callao. (Montero y Vidal, <i lang="es">Hist. de Filipinas</i>, i, p.
462, note.)</p>
<p class="par footnote">See Raynal&rsquo;s account of the policy
pursued in the New World by Spain, its results on both that country and
the colonies, and the elements of weakness in it, in <i lang="fr">Etab.
et com. des Europ&eacute;ens</i>, ii, pp. 290&ndash;356.&nbsp;<a class=

<i lang="es">comercio</i>, a word which has numerous meanings,
according to the context; here evidently meaning a chamber of commerce,
or an executive committee to look after the interests of the
shippers.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd21e876src">&uarr;</a></p>
<p class="par footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e933" href="#xd21e933src" name="xd21e933">12</a></span> At the
outset, Pintado makes some statements to the effect that the Council of
the Indias had taken the action which led to the decree of 1734,
without consulting Cadiz, and had made certain inquiries and
consultations with the Manila deputies alone. A marginal note by Abreu
corrects this, saying, &ldquo;Not only with the deputies; for the
fiscal of the Council was heard [on the subject], who is impartial
between the two commercial bodies.&rdquo;&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=
"#xd21e933src">&uarr;</a></p>
<p class="par footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e938" href="#xd21e938src" name="xd21e938">13</a></span> The Manila
deputies, however, claimed that the decree of 1726 did not reach the
islands until 1730, so that it was first put into practice in that
year, the five years&rsquo; term, therefore, including the shipment of
1734. (<i lang="es">Extracto</i>, fol. 150, 185 and verso, 190

<p class="par footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e962" href="#xd21e962src" name="xd21e962">14</a></span> One of the
tables at the end of Raynal&rsquo;s atlas volume gives an itemized list
of the cargoes carried by the &ldquo;last eight Spanish trading-fleets
to Vera Cruz&rdquo;&mdash;that is, the last eight preceding
Raynal&rsquo;s work. Their cargoes were of the following amounts: in
1733 (under command of Torrez), 618,595 cubic palmos; 1735
(Pintado&rsquo;s), 620,000; 1757 (Villena&rsquo;s), 618,557; 1760
(Reggio&rsquo;s), 841,717; 1765 (Idiaques&rsquo;s), 486,943; 1768
(Tilly&rsquo;s), 452,282; 1772 (Cordova&rsquo;s), 914,807; 1776
(Ulloa&rsquo;s), 934,366. But one of these fleets carried cinnamon,
that of 1735; and cloves appear only in the trifling amount of 50
quintals, in 1768. The chief articles enumerated&mdash;which appear in
every year&rsquo;s list&mdash;are paper, wax, iron, steel; brandy,
wine, and oil; and unbleached stuffs [linens?] from Brabant.
Quicksilver was carried in only 1765 and 1768, 7,506 and 8,000 quintals
respectively. Wrought iron was sent in five of these shipments, but in
no considerable quantity except in 1765, when also was sent 2,724
barrels of tin-plate (in other cargoes, in but trifling amounts). Silk
ribbons made a solitary appearance in 1757, to the extent of 1,000
pieces&mdash;as did 1,000 &ldquo;swords to be mounted with
hilts,&rdquo; in 1765. The last two fleets carried consignments of
gun-flints, respectively 650 and 386 thousand-weight.</p>
<p class="par footnote">It is evident, however, from another table
(which follows the above), that Spanish commerce had much activity
outside the trading-fleets; this shows the amounts of
&ldquo;merchandise which left the ports of Spain each year from 1748 to
1753 for its colonies on the continent of America; duties which they
have paid; their current value in the New World; expenses which they
have borne; their net product for the metropolis [<i>i.e.</i>,
Cadiz].&rdquo; Of these goods, the only one monopolized by the crown
was quicksilver, to the amount of 3,600,000 livres&rsquo; worth. The
greater part of this merchandise consisted of cloth and stuffs, of
silk, linen, and wool; there was a considerable amount of iron, paper,
wax, brandy, wine, and oil; and to Nueva Espa&ntilde;a was sent
1,000,000 livres&rsquo; worth of cinnamon, and to Caracas 10,000
barrels of flour. Of the goods sent to Nueva Espa&ntilde;a (not
counting the quicksilver), 6,367,297 livres&rsquo; worth were of
Spanish production, and 14,401,815 of foreign. The import duties levied
on the latter at Cadiz amounted to 1,185,343 livres, and the export
duties on both Spanish and foreign to 1,245,059; and admiralty and
aver&iacute;a duties besides came to 419,623. The goods on board, then,
cost 23,619,137 livres, to which must be added the following charges:
transportation to America, 3,617,623; import duties and alcavala in
America, 4,327,473; commissions on sales and return freight,
3,231,296&mdash;a total of 34,795,529 livres. The value of this
merchandise in America was arbitrated at 43,274,787 livres; deducting
the above costs, a profit of 8,479,258 livres remains from the
merchandise sent from Spain to Nueva Espa&ntilde;a. On the return
voyage, the main part of the cargoes was in gold and
silver&mdash;6,480,000 livres&rsquo; worth for the king, and 37,716,047
for the merchants; the crown monopolized copper and cacao, 259,200 and
12,960 respectively; the cochineal was worth 6,426,000 livres, and the
indigo 4,160,160; and various drugs, dyes, etc. made with these a total
of 56,216,533 livres (all these values being those estimated in
America). To this cost must be added freight charges, 1,491,543 livres;
and various duties to the crown (including customs, admiralty, church,
etc., the largest being for &ldquo;indult and coast-guards&rdquo;),
amounting to 6,428,987. Consequently, when the ships arrived at Cadiz
the value of the gold and silver had been reduced to 5,625,607 livres
for the king, and 32,775,345 for the merchants; while the cost of the
other commodities had increased from 12,020,486 livres to 14,145,922.
The current value in Europe of these goods (not including the gold and
silver) was 18,465,419 livres, a gain over the entire cost of 4,319,497
livres (30&frac12; per cent)&mdash;of which 124,527 belonged to the
king, and the remainder to the merchants, as the net proceeds on the
commerce between Spain and Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, outside of the precious
metals, in both the outward and return voyages each
year.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd21e962src">&uarr;</a></p>

<h2 class="main">LETTER FROM THE ECCLESIASTICAL CABILDO TO FELIPE
III</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first salute">Sire:</p>
<p class="par">Considering that your Majesty&rsquo;s great desire has
always shown that these Filipinas Islands should increase in all
things, and they may without doubt increase greatly for the service of
God and that of your Majesty, if perchance your Majesty&rsquo;s
ministers aid them by observing the royal decrees (for no more would be
necessary); understanding also that some of those religious who come
here would like to have your Majesty grant them favor by giving them a
university in these islands,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1630src" href=
"#xd21e1630" name="xd21e1630src">1</a> and authority to confer the
degrees of bachelor, licentiate, and other degrees: we have considered
that, the case having been well examined, this is not fitting, either
for the service of your Majesty, or for the welfare and increase of
this land. We believe that we shall give very clear and very apparent
reasons for this. For if a religious order has the said university,
never will the children and those born in this country have any
advantage, nor will they advance any in letters. For, since it is a
fact that virtue increases with reward, which is the honor, if the
religious hold all the professorships, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb98" href="#pb98" name="pb98">98</a>]</span>the seculars will have no
incentive which encourages them to rise and to study solidly. A
professorship and the thought of being able to get one makes many
study. Second, it would be a great pity and even a great cause of ruin
for the country, if the children of its inhabitants did not have
anything more to which to aspire than a benefice of Indians, or at most
one single benefice which exists, of Spaniards, in all this
archbishopric, namely, this curacy of Manila, and four or five others
of Indians, which exist in all these islands. All of those benefices
will be given by the bishops to their servants unless students are
found here such that their conscience obliges them to favor such
students. If the professorships should be given only to religious, no
encouragement could be given to the children of the citizens here to
study earnestly, at the most more than a little grammar. For that would
be enough for them so that a benefice might be given them. Third, it is
necessary for the religious orders themselves here, for the children of
citizens to have the wherewithal with which to be encouraged to study,
and to pretend to honorable and great things. For, by such people must
the orders be fed and sustained. And it is fitting that those who
should take the habit in them should have studied very well, and with
honorable intention, and not that men of little mind and learning
should enter the orders. Fourth, it is right that this metropolitan
church of Manila and the other cathedrals of these islands should have
men truly erudite who may enter them and hold their prebends. This is
impossible to attain if all the seculars who enter them must be only
students, and only scholars, and no one can be a master, or hold a
professorship, and it is well known how unadvisable <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href="#pb99" name="pb99">99</a>]</span>that is.
It is right and necessary for the mother churches to have in their own
body very eminent men, and no one is eminent ordinarily but those who
have taught and held professorships. Fifth, the religious will be well
able to teach theology and the arts, but canons and laws, which,
particularly the canons, are also necessary for churches and for the
community, cannot be taught by religious. And, in fact, the custom of
the Catholic church has always been to leave in the universities,
especially in those which are located in the capitals of notable
provinces, as is that of this country, the door open to seculars and to
religious, and to all, in order that they may compete for the
professorships. This custom has always been observed by the Catholic
sovereigns of Castilla, not only in Salamanca, Valladolid, and
Alcal&aacute;, and in the other parts of Espa&ntilde;a, but also in the
Yndias. Considering these so forcible reasons, which are laid at your
Majesty&rsquo;s feet, we petition that your Majesty do not allow a
university to be conceded to a religious order, although any ask it,
and that the secular estate be not so abased in these islands that we
should be excluded from a thing which has always been so common and so
peculiar to the seculars in the Church. And if, for the present, your
Majesty should be pleased to commission some religious to lecture in
arts and theology, we know that there are religious in these islands
who are friends of sane doctrines, and hostile to all innovation, and
zealous for the honor of God, who will attend to this ministry without
it being necessary for them (nor do they wish it) to meddle in giving
degrees, but who only wish to be useful and to teach. If your Majesty
would be so pleased, we believe that it would be very suitable for
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb100" href="#pb100" name=
"pb100">100</a>]</span>such persons to be appointed until there be more
people to study, and that you be informed by the archbishop of this
city, and should it appear fitting, by the governor together with him.
Such appointees should not necessarily be of one order merely, but from
those which the archbishop shall deem best, and your Majesty should
order that very learned persons, and those inclined to simple doctrines
be chosen. By so doing this will be fulfilled until such time that your
Majesty shows us the grace of placing this in greater perfection and in
such form that we seculars may have a place according to the merits of
each one. May God preserve your Majesty many years, as is petitioned in
this holy church ceaselessly. Manila, July twelve, one thousand six
hundred and one. The vassals and chaplains of your Majesty.</p>

<p class="par">353 [<i>i.e.</i>, 153]. A few months after the
foundation of the congregation,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1730src"
href="#xd21e1730" name="xd21e1730src">2</a> a beginning was given to
the college and seminary of San Joseph, which was not less desired by
the principal citizens of Manila than was the congregation. It had been
discussed already before this, and Governor Don Luis Perez
Dasmari&ntilde;as had enacted, on the fifteenth of the month of August
one thousand five hundred and ninety-five, an act in regard to it, in
obedience to and in execution <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb102"
href="#pb102" name="pb102">102</a>]</span>of a royal decree of one
thousand five hundred and eighty-five, in which his Majesty commands
Doctor Santiago de Vera, his governor in these islands, or the person
in whose charge should be their government, to ascertain in what manner
a college and seminary, where the sons of the Spanish inhabitants of
these islands, under the care and management of the fathers of the
Society, can be instructed in virtue and letters, may be instituted.
Although the act was given out from that time by the governor, at the
advice of Doctor Don Antonio de Morga, lieutenant general and assessor
of the governor, on account of difficulties which always exist in
whatever depends on the royal treasury, that work was suspended until
the arrival of the father visitor, Diego Garcia,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1744src" href="#xd21e1744" name="xd21e1744src">3</a> with his
ardent desire of putting into execution all the means for the service
of God and the greater welfare of his neighbors. From the mountains of
Antipolo, where he was, he charged Father Pedro Chirino, rector of the
college of Manila, independently of the said act, to treat with
Governor Don Francisco Tello, the auditors of the royal Audiencia
(which had been re&euml;stablished in these islands), and the two
cabildos (ecclesiastical and secular), in regard to this
matter.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1750src" href="#xd21e1750" name=
"xd21e1750src">4</a> The father found them all not only kind but
desirous of its execution, for some of them had sons or nephews without
the necessary education, for lack of the college.</p>
<p class="par">154. Having seen the readiness and desire of all, the
father visitor ordered some houses near our college to be made ready
for that purpose. He appointed Father Luis Gomez<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1758src" href="#xd21e1758" name="xd21e1758src">5</a> rector of
the future <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href="#pb103" name=
"pb103">103</a>]</span>college, and ordered him to choose some picked
students as collegiates, and gowns and becas of the color now used to
be prepared. He ordered the necessary licenses of the ordinary and of
the secular government to be obtained; and that after they had been
obtained, a beginning should really be made to the college and seminary
with the fitting solemnity. It was to be named after San Joseph, on
account of the special devotion that he had for that holy patriarch.
The rector appointed exerted himself and, by virtue of his efforts,
obtained the licenses from Governor Don Francisco Tello, and from the
provisor judge and vicar-general of the archbishopric which was then
vacant. Both licenses were dated August twenty-five, one thousand six
hundred and one. Inasmuch as everything was now ready, a day was
appointed for the erection of said college in due form. The governor
and royal Audiencia, the provisor and vicar-general, some capitulars,
the secular cabildo, the orders, and many others of the best people
assembled in the chapel of the houses which had been prepared for the
habitation and dwelling of the collegiates. Gowns and becas were given
to Don Pedro de Tello, nephew of the governor; to Don Antonio de Morga,
son of the senior auditor of that name; and other sons of the principal
citizens up to the number of thirteen. Mass was celebrated by the
archdeacon of the cathedral, Don Francisco Gomez de Arellano, who
afterwards became dean. The new collegiates recited two prayers, one in
Latin and the other in Spanish verses, in which with elegance,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href="#pb104" name=
"pb104">104</a>]</span>gravity, and in a pleasing manner, they declared
the reason for the undertaking and the end of the new foundation, and
the profit which could be promised to the community from it. They were
received with general applause. Then many persons went through the
house, and admired the neatness and fitness of the lodgings, beds, and
desks, and the good order in everything. The number of the collegiates
soon increased to twenty, which for a beginning and in a country so new
and which professes rather the military and mercantile life than that
of letters, was not to be esteemed lightly. After having made the
foundation in the said form, the father visitor came to visit the new
college, and with his presence, authority, and prudence, they attained
great prestige. He gave the collegiates rules, and a method of living,
proportionate to the profession of students. He made for them and for
the rector and masters the necessary statutes, so that they might be
kept in the future, as was done. By means of that in a few years
students were seen to graduate from this college very advanced in
letters and fit for offices and benefices; and others, sensible and
devout, who, touched by God, entered the religious life.</p>
<p class="par">155. The support of the collegiates during that time was
obtained by themselves with a certain sum of money which each one of
them gave, and which, administered by the procurator of the college,
was sufficient for their sustenance and decent support. Some fixed
income for the support of the rector and teachers, and succor for some
students of quality and ability, who by the poverty of their parents
could not meet their expenses with the sum which was charged, was
greatly desired. Our Lord provided <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105"
href="#pb105" name="pb105">105</a>]</span>that by means of the
Christian and noble governor of Mindanao, Estevan Rodriguez de
Figueroa, who (as we have remarked above) had already founded and
endowed the principal college of the Society in Manila. Being so
favorable to the good work, he, when making his will as he embarked in
Oton for the conquest of Mindanao, in which he named his daughters as
his heirs, in case of their death before they reached a competent age,
made a pupillary substitution in favor of this college and seminary. He
ordered that in such an event, the property of either one of his two
daughters should pass to the Society of Manila for the purpose of
building a house, and founding a college and seminary for the education
of youth. That event happened, for the younger of his two daughters
named Do&ntilde;a Juana died at a very tender age, being drowned with
her uncle Andres Duarte, a &ldquo;twenty-four&rdquo; of Xerez, in the
wreck of the ship &ldquo;San Antonio.&rdquo; Therefore, by virtue of
the clause of the will of the said governor, the college of San Joseph
inherited the possession which belonged to it. With that property this
college and seminary of San Joseph was instituted and founded anew with
public ecclesiastical and secular authority, on February twenty-eight,
one thousand six hundred and ten, as appears from the act of its
foundation which reads as follows.</p>
<p class="par">156. &ldquo;In the city of Manila, February
twenty-eight, one thousand six hundred and ten, in the college of the
Society of Jesus of this said city, before the treasurer, Don Luis de
Herrera Sandoval: the provisor and vicar-general of this archbishopric,
apostolic commissary, subdelegate-general of the Holy Crusade in these
islands, Father Gregorio Lopez, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb106"
href="#pb106" name="pb106">106</a>]</span>provincial of the said
college of the Society of Jesus, made a presentation of the acts
contained in the four preliminary leaves of this book, signed by his
name, and sealed with the seal of his office. That signature appears to
be that of said father provincial. I, the present secretary, attest
that I know him. He also presented the original licenses of the cantor,
Santiago de Castro, former provisor and vicar-general of this
archbishopric, and of Don Francisco Tello, former governor and
captain-general of these islands, copies of which are inserted in these
acts. Said licenses are for the foundation of the said college of San
Joseph of this city of Manila, as is contained in them more minutely. I
attest that I have seen said original licenses and that they are
conserved in the archives of the said Society. One of them is
countersigned by Geronimo de Alcaraz, former notary-public of this
archbishopric, and the other by Gaspar de Acebo, former government
secretary of these islands. The said father provincial declared that by
virtue of the clause of the will of Captain Estevan Rodriguez de
Figueroa, deceased, which is contained in the said acts, where he
appears to be the patron of said college of San Joseph, he appointed
and presented as collegiates of said college, Don Felipe de Figueroa,
son of Don Lorenco de Figueroa and Do&ntilde;a Ana de Salazar, his
wife; Gabriel de Santillan, son of Captain Ventura de Santillan and
Do&ntilde;a Flora de Aguilar, his wife; and Gabriel Venegas, son of Don
Goncalo Flores and Do&ntilde;a Juana Bautista, his wife: all
inhabitants of this city, so that as such appointed collegiates they
might be supported by the said income of the said college, according to
the clause of its institution, as appears from the appointment above,
which was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href="#pb107" name=
"pb107">107</a>]</span>dated in this city on St. Bernard&rsquo;s day,
August twenty of the former year, one thousand six hundred. Although
the said appointment is valid, legal, and sufficient, as it was made by
the patron whom the said testator appoints, for greater validity he
declared that he again presented&mdash;and he did present&mdash;the
said three collegiates above named. And for greater solemnity of this
act, as it was the first, the said provisor and vicar-general begged
that his judicial authority be interposed and renewed, and that the
license of said Santiago de Castro, his predecessor, be confirmed. The
said provisor and vicar-general, having also read the said acts and
original licenses, declared that, so far as it concerns him, he
approved&mdash;and he did approve&mdash;the appointment made of the
said Don Felipe de Figueroa, Gabriel de Santillan, and Gabriel Venegas;
and he declared that he confirmed&mdash;and he did confirm&mdash;the
said license of the said Santiago de Castro, his predecessor, and said
that he again gave it&mdash;and he did give it&mdash;for the college
founded with an income. For that effect, for greater validity, the said
father provincial, in the presence of the said provisor and of me, the
said secretary, delivered the three said collegiates to Father Pedro de
Velasco, appointed rector of the said college. The latter received them
as said collegiates of said college, so that they might be supported by
it. All the above was done in my presence, and that of the witnesses
who were present, brothers Diego de Sarsuela, Juan de Larrea, and
Martin de Lisarde of the said Society; and the said father provincial,
the said provisor; and the said Father Pedro de Velasco affixed their
signatures to it before me, Pedro de Roxas, secretary and
notary-public.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">157. Before making this second institution of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href="#pb108" name=
"pb108">108</a>]</span>college, account had been given to his Majesty
in his royal Council of the Indias, of the legacy and bequest of
Governor Estevan Rodriguez, and the possession by the Society in Manila
of the property of Do&ntilde;a Juana de Figueroa, and permission was
petitioned to bring from Mexico to Manila the money belonging to the
said bequest, since it had to serve for the foundation of the college
for the public welfare and profit of the islands. His Majesty,
considering himself as greatly served by it, had ordered his royal
decree despatched in accordance with this. In order that one may see
the esteem of the Council for that work, that decree faithfully copied
from its original will be placed here. It is as follows.</p>
<p class="par">158. &ldquo;The King. Don Luis de Velasco, my viceroy,
governor, and captain-general of Nueva-Espa&ntilde;a, or the person or
persons, in whose charge may be the government of that country: On the
part of Diego Cordova, of the Society of Jesus, and its procurator of
the Indias, I have been informed that Governor Estevan Rodriguez de
Figueroa, when he went to accomplish the conquest of the island of
Mindanao in the Filipinas, where his enemies killed him, made a will
under whose disposition he died, by which, desiring that the youth [of
Filipinas] be occupied in virtue, he ordered that if either of his
daughters should die while a minor, a college seminary should be
founded in the city of Manila with the portion of the inheritance which
belonged to such deceased girl, so that the sons of inhabitants of the
said islands might study therein; and he left as patron of it the
provincial of the Society of Jesus of those islands. Inasmuch as the
younger daughter has died while a minor, the possession of that
inheritance <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href="#pb109" name=
"pb109">109</a>]</span>which fell to her was given to the said Society.
Consequently, the said college seminary is to be founded in the said
city of Manila with that inheritance. There is very great need of that
college in that city for study, and for the rearing of ministers of the
holy gospel. The property with which the said seminary is to be founded

interest for its conservation and maintenance, inasmuch as there is
nothing in which to invest it in the said islands. He petitions me
that, in consideration of the great fruit which will be attained in
those islands from that foundation, and in consideration of the many
good services of said governor, I grant the concession of giving the
license so that the proceeds from the property which is in that said
city for the foundation and support of the said seminary, be allowed to
pass thence to the said islands freely, notwithstanding the
prohibition, with a sworn certification of the procurator of the said
Society of Jesus of the said islands, to the effect that what thus
passes is the gain or proceeds of the property of the said seminary, as
there is nothing in the islands in which the said money can be invested
as abovesaid. The members of my Council of the Assembly of the Indias
having examined it, and having considered the abovesaid, I have
considered it fitting to have this my decree issued. I command you
thereby that, in each one of two years you allow to pass from that city
to the said islands the sum which shall appear necessary to you for the
said effect from the said property, if it does not exceed six hundred
ducados; and that that sum be included in the quantity which I have
given permission to be sent from that kingdom <span class=

the said Filipinas Islands, notwithstanding any order to the contrary,
which for this time and in regard to this matter I dispense with. The
said two years you shall send me a minutely detailed account of the
value of the said property, and the district where it is invested and
in what, and the amount of the proceeds thereof each year, and what it
is advisable to enact concerning the whole matter. That, with your
opinion you shall send to the said my Council of the Assembly, so that
after examining it the advisable measures may be taken. Given in
Valladolid, September thirteen, one thousand six hundred and eight.</p>

forty-seven, by which it was protected in its priority and possession
of precedence in the public acts to that of Santo Thomas. That same

conquest of Mindanao, made (March 16, 1596) his will in which he
declares: &ldquo;And inasmuch as, ... some of the said my children may

as their father and legitimate administrator, to make a will for them.
In such case availing myself of the said faculty, I order and command

living, from the said third and remainder of the fifth. For if either
one or the other of the two casualties occur, a house shall be built
next the Society of Jesus, of the city of Manila, sufficient, and which
shall be used, for a college and seminary for boys, where all those may
enter who desire to study the first letters in such seminary. I request
and charge the provincial, at such time, of the Society of Jesus, to
take it under his care and to give to such boys sufficient teachers for

<p class="par">In 1601, the Jesuits themselves founded a college,
primarily through the efforts of Father Diego Garcia, who went to the
Philippines as visitor in 1599. He ordered Father Pedro Chirino,
independently of the act of Luis Perez Dasmari&ntilde;as, to plan for
the founding of a college for the Society. The first rector was Father
Luis Gomez, who obtained the licenses of both ecclesiastical and civil
authorities, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href="#pb114" name=
"pb114">114</a>]</span>August 25 of that year. The cantor, Santiago de
Castro, provisor and vicar-general of the archbishopric of Manila,
acting in vacant see, in view of the petition presented by Father
Gomez, grants &ldquo;license to said religious of the Society of Jesus,
and to the said Father Luis Gomez, to found said college of San
Jos&eacute;.&rdquo; Governor Francisco Tello, on the same date, grants
the civil license for the erection of the college in view of
Gomez&rsquo;s petition, the erection being for the rearing &ldquo;in
virtue and letters of some Spanish youth, in view of the necessity of
training ministers of the gospel of whom there is a lack in this land
for the need of said college.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1873src" href="#xd21e1873" name="xd21e1873src">10</a> The new
college was instituted with thirteen collegiates, and one father and
one brother of the Society who were placed at its head to look after
the spiritual and economic managements respectively.</p>
<p class="par">October 30, 1604, a royal decree was despatched, which
was received by the royal Audiencia at Manila, July 10, 1606, ordering
&ldquo;information in regard to the plan that could be inaugurated for
the exercise of letters in these islands, and the lecturing by some
professors without there being any university.&rdquo; The Audiencia in
its reply states the death by shipwreck of the younger daughter of
Rodriguez de Figueroa (1605), and that the Society of Jesus had entered
suit for her estate, in accordance with the will of her father, and
that they had been given possession of it.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1884src" href="#xd21e1884" name="xd21e1884src">11</a> Since a
considerable part of Rodriguez de Figueroa&rsquo;s goods were in
Mexico, and since <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb115" href="#pb115"
name="pb115">115</a>]</span>there was a royal prohibition forbidding
money to be transferred from one territory to another, the Jesuits
requested from the king, through their procurator at Madrid, permission
to transfer the necessary money from Mexico to the islands, in order to
found the college. Three royal decrees were issued in accordance with
this petition, two asking for reports from the archbishop and
Audiencia, and one (September 13, 1608)<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1898src" href="#xd21e1898" name="xd21e1898src">12</a> granting
permission for the founding of a college and seminary in the city of
Manila. By the beginning of 1610, the Jesuits realized the terms of the
will of Rodriguez de Figueroa, and on February 28 of that year, the
licenses, given formerly to Luis Gomez in 1601, were confirmed by the
provisor for the college now founded with an income.<a class="noteref"

<p class="par">In a letter to the Jesuit general, June 11, 1611, Father
Gregorio Lopez writes of the flourishing condition of the college and
seminary of San Jos&eacute;. He says: &ldquo;In the seminary of San
Joseph, our pupils are reared with the virtue of which advice was given
in former years. Some are inclined to our rule, and others to that of
the other orders. Three have embraced that of the Order of St
Augustine. The seminary has been improved this year with a fine new
refectory built of stone, with a very large hall for the lodging of the
collegiates, and the work which will be one of the best in the city, is
progressing.&rdquo; Diego V&aacute;zquez de Mercado, archbishop of
Manila, insists on the idea of the foundation of the university, which
was undervalued by Felipe III, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb116"
href="#pb116" name="pb116">116</a>]</span>after the unfavorable report
of Benavides, and in a letter of June 24, 1612, to the king, praises
the work of the college and asks that graduates therefrom in arts and
theology be granted degrees. Archbishop Garcia Serrano writes to Felipe
IV, July 25, 1621, regarding the colleges of San Jos&eacute; and Santo
Tom&aacute;s: &ldquo;There are two colleges for students in the city,
one founded by Captain Estevan Rodriguez de Figueroa, which is in
charge of the fathers of the Society of Jesus, whence the collegiates
go to the college of the same Society, which is near by, to hear
lectures in grammar, philosophy, and scholastic and moral theology. It
has twenty collegiates with the beca at present, some of whom pay for
their tuition, while others are aided by charity, as the income derived
from the founder serves now to support but few because it was spent in
building said college. The other college is called Santo Tomas de
Aquino and is in charge of the Order of St. Dominic, and is very near
their convent. It is not more than two years since collegiates entered
it. It was founded with alms of deceased persons and others given by
the living which the fathers have procured. It also has some income,
and it is making progress. It has also twenty collegiates with the
beca, some of whom also pay for their tuition, while others are
supported by charity and by other persons. They study grammar,
philosophy, and theology in the said college, where they have a rector
and masters of the Order of St. Dominic. These two colleges greatly
ennoble the city, and the sons of the inhabitants of these islands are
being reared therein in civilization, virtue, and good letters. It will
be of the highest importance for their progress for your Majesty to
honor them by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href="#pb117" name=
"pb117">117</a>]</span>giving them license to grant degrees in the
courses taught in them.&rdquo; Another letter from Serrano, July 30 of
the same year, notes that the secular priests have increased so greatly
in his archbishopric because of the number that have graduated from the
college and seminary of the Jesuits that he has not places for them and
they suffer great poverty. The same is true of those who have studied
in the college of Santo Tom&aacute;s. In a letter of August 15, 1624,
he notes that the college of San Jos&eacute; has obtained the right to
grant university degrees, by a papal brief, without the necessity of
the graduates going to other universities, and petitions that the
rector be allowed to grant the degrees in person. In 1627, Pedro
Chirino was dean of the law faculty of the university.<a class=

verdict in favor of the Jesuits, May 10, 1647, declaring that all
public acts of the college of San Jos&eacute; had precedence over those
of Santo Tom&aacute;s, as the former had been founded over eighteen
years earlier. This sentence was confirmed in review, July 29 of the
same year, and again by the royal Council of the Indias, August 12,
1652, on examination, and again on review, November 25 of the same
year. The college of Santo Tom&aacute;s, being dissatisfied with the

these fellowships was incorporated in the property of the college,

other fellowships founded in 1717 (although only made effective in
1720), by Domingo de Valencia, bishop-elect of Nueva C&aacute;ceres,

they were intended for Spanish creoles born in Manila. Besides the

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">&ldquo;The King. President and auditors of my
royal Audiencia of the Philipinas Islands, which is established in the
city of Manila: In a letter dated July twelve, of the year one thousand
seven hundred and sixty-nine, you informed me, with testimony, that
having noted that the four Piarist religious whom the present right
reverend archbishop of that metropolitan church took in his company,
did not present the licenses which they carried in order that they
might go to those islands, and that they were entering various posts
outside the assistancy in the said archbishop&rsquo;s house; and in
consideration of the fact that they had no other house in those
islands, and that there was no distinction among them which could prove
that they had a prelate: you deemed it advisable to proceed to the
observation of the laws in such cases. You petitioned, by means of
political and judicial measures, that the purpose of those religious be
investigated, and the amphibological replies of the above-mentioned
archbishop could not quiet your anxiety, but the rather increased it,
so that you proceeded to the remonstrances which you made to the
governor, in regard to his having delivered the royal college of San
Jos&eacute;ph, which was under the charge of the expelled regulars of
the Society, to Father Martin de San Antonio, abbot of the Piarist
fathers, and the reported rector of the seminary of the archbishop, so
that those who intended to become ordained might live therein, and be
instructed in ethics, also under the direction of the said Father
Martin. You declared that from your remonstrances to the
above-mentioned governor, could be recognized the wrongs which resulted
from that measure, which was quite contrary to what was ordered in the
instructions for the banishment of the above-mentioned <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb126" href="#pb126" name=
"pb126">126</a>]</span>regulars of the Society, and contrary to the
right which those then living in the college had legally acquired of
maintaining themselves therein, as well as those who should succeed
them in the future, without it being possible to make a pretext of any
innovation because of the lack of teachers. For there would be no lack
of seculars to substitute for the present, and in time, persons worthy
to maintain this praiseworthy foundation could be trained. Finally, not
having any information regarding the reasons that moved the governor to
this (apparently) strange resolution, you were unable to conform to it
or pass it by without taking any notice of it, and alone having
observed your first obligation, namely, to report to me what you were
discussing as advisable to my royal service and the welfare of my
vassals, you represented what had occurred, so that after having
examined the matter, I might deign to determine what is most fitting to
my royal pleasure. The abovesaid was examined in my Council of the
Indias, together with what was reported by Don Pedro Calderon Enriquez,
togated lawyer of the said my Council, regarding it, of the antecedents
of the matter, and of what was reported at the same time in regard to
it, with their respective testimonies, by the former governor and
captain-general of those islands, Don Joseph Raon, and the
above-mentioned archbishop, in letters from March twelve to July
twenty-nine of the above-cited year one thousand seven hundred and
sixty-nine, my fiscal made his statement; and consulted with me in
regard to it on September thirteen of last year, with consideration of
the indiscretion with which the above-mentioned governor, Don Joseph
Raon, transgressed by placing <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb127"
href="#pb127" name="pb127">127</a>]</span>the royal college of San
Jos&eacute;ph of that city under the direction of Father Mart&iacute;n
de San Antonio, the abbot of the Piarists, thus rendering it necessary
for those who obtained their becas to leave the college, and abandon
them, and the manner in which you opposed the previously-noted
spoliation, as a matter contrary to my royal intentions and the product
of most grave wrongs and pernicious consequences, as is shown in the
fact that the above-mentioned college was founded for the purpose of
teaching therein grammar, philosophy, and theology to the children of
the principal Spanish persons and subjects of that city. Twenty becas
were created therein for a like number of collegiates, and the teaching
of the same and their direction was given to the expelled regulars of
the Society. The king, my father deigned to receive it under his
sovereign protection, May three, of the year one thousand seven hundred
and twenty-two, and decorate it with the title of &lsquo;Royal <i lang=
"la">ad honorem</i>,&rsquo; provided that it should have no other
patrons, and under the express condition that it never should have
such, or be able to cause any burden or embarrassment to my royal
exchequer. The above-mentioned order of the Society did not have
therein other right than the above-mentioned direction and government.
Consequently, since the royal decree of July nine, one thousand six
hundred and sixty-nine, which was inserted in the decree of April five
of the above-mentioned year one thousand seven hundred and seventy, by
which the collection of the measures in regard to the seizure of the
temporalities of the said expelled regulars was sent to those my
dominions of America, ordered that there be no innovation in the
colleges or secular houses whose direction <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb128" href="#pb128" name="pb128">128</a>]</span>and
instruction were entrusted to them, as is proved by section thirty of
the first decree, the collegiates of the college of San Jos&eacute;ph
could not be despoiled of their becas in order to expel them from the
college, nor could the Trent seminary be removed to the above-mentioned
house, without directly violating the orders of the above-mentioned
decrees. To the abovesaid is added that the above-mentioned four
Piarist religious went to those islands with no other purpose than to
act as attendants of the above-mentioned archbishop, whence is inferred
the just motive which you had in advising the said prelate to keep them
in his company; in expressing wonder that one of them should be
entrusted with the direction of the above-mentioned royal college of
San Joseph; in advising Governor Don Joseph Raon of the illegality of
the abovesaid act, and of the fatal results which were accessory to
that of the expulsion of those who had obtained their becas; and in
resolving that my royal mind be instructed in regard to the abovesaid
measures so that I might deign to take those measures which should
appear most desirable to me for their remedy. Consequently, not only is
there not found in your operations the slightest motive that justifies
the complaint which the above-mentioned archbishop has brought forward
in his said letter, but, on the contrary, it is to be noted that you
did no other thing in whatever you performed, than to comply with the
mandates of the laws. The said governor and the above-mentioned
prelate, not being able to ignore the fact of the existence of the
above-mentioned college, and of the solemnity with which it had been
founded, it became very worthy of attention that in their reports
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb129" href="#pb129" name=
"pb129">129</a>]</span>they were silent in regard to this foundation,
both commendable and made by the above-mentioned king, my father, and
with his royal name, and transgressed in founding a new college
seminary with Indian collegiates, without authority or obligation to do
so. That is still more aggravated by the fact of the spoliation of the
Spanish collegiates of their possession of the said college of San
Joseph by erecting in it what they call a seminary for Indians, since
for these and the Sangley mestizos there is the above-mentioned college
of San Juan de Letran, and the conciliar seminary was already founded.
By such violent spoliation, not only were the collegiates outraged, but
also the inhabitants of that city exasperated, so that with such acts
of despotism they hate to live there, and the islands are being
depopulated of Spaniards, as is happening. Under these circumstances
and inasmuch as the above-mentioned college of San Joseph has nothing
in common with the expelled regulars, as the latter had only the
administration and direction of the college, and this having ceased
with their expulsion, the above-mentioned governor ought to appoint a
secular of good morals from those who shall have been collegiates in
the said college, as such will be already instructed as to its
government, as rector and administrator, with obligation of rendering a
yearly report. He must not allow the archbishop to meddle with anything
pertaining to the said college, as it is under my royal protection,
and, consequently, wholly independent of the ecclesiastical ordinary,
as are the other pious foundations mentioned by the Council of Trent.
The governor ought not to permit the archbishop to meddle in anything
concerning the seminary, as <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href=
"#pb130" name="pb130">130</a>]</span>there is also a royal foundation,
namely, that of San Phelipe, which appears to have been incorporated
after the above-mentioned San Joseph; and the good relations that the
governor claims to have with the archbishop can not serve to relieve
the former of blame, for he ought to have good relations with him
within suitable limits, and not with total abandonment of the rights
which are entrusted to him. I have resolved, by virtue of what is
contrary to my royal intentions, as is the above-mentioned spoliation
and expulsion, not to pay any heed to the complaint of the said
prelate; to approve whatever you have done in the particular under
discussion; to order and command the present governor and
captain-general of those islands, and to charge the said archbishop (as
is done by despatches of this date) that they shall in the future leave
things in the condition and state in which they existed before the
above-mentioned innovations were made, and that the collegiates must go
to take their studies to the university of Santo Tom&aacute;s of that
city; and to inform you thereof (as I do) for your intelligence. Thus
is my will. Given in El Pardo, March twenty-one, one thousand seven
hundred and seventy-one.</p>

regard to making an ecclesiastical seminary out of the college of San

the college of San Jos&eacute;, and the occupations of the four
Piarists who had accompanied the archbishop to the Philippines.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">In 1777, Doctor Ignacio de Salazar, magistral of the
Manila cathedral, was chosen rector and administrator of the college.
From that date until 1879, the position of rector and administrator of
the college was always confirmed by the governors-general to the dean
or other dignitary of the Manila cathedral. Accounts of the
administration of the college were to be rendered every three years, or
annually. The management of the college was not successful, and the
administration of the properties was negligent and possibly corrupt
during some years. The field of secondary education which it had
attempted to fill came to be occupied by newer and more successful
institutions, such as the Ateneo Municipal and the college of San Juan
de Letran.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2175src" href="#xd21e2175" name=
"xd21e2175src">37</a></p>
<p class="par">From the books of the university of Santo Tom&aacute;s,
it seems that a few years after the expulsion of the Jesuits, if not
immediately, instruction on philosophy and the natural sciences was
resumed, and that two professors were appointed for that purpose, and
that in 1795 the government of the islands recommended the abolition of
such instruction, applying the revenues therefrom to the payment of the
fees of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb132" href="#pb132" name=
"pb132">132</a>]</span>institutes and law courses, which recommendation
was not carried out on account of an unfavorable report of the faculty
of the university. Only grammar and philosophy were taught until 1866,
and pupils were required to pass an examination in the university of
Santo Tom&aacute;s before two professors appointed for the purpose, in
order to legalize their courses. The first four years of secondary
instruction were established at this period.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2188src" href="#xd21e2188" name="xd21e2188src">38</a></p>
<p class="par">Between the years 1860 and 1870, the question of the
conversion of the college into a professional school of some
sort&mdash;arts, agriculture, or medicine&mdash;was much discussed,
particularly its conversion into a school of medicine and pharmacy.
Finally, in 1867, a board consisting of the rectors of the university,
Ateneo Municipal, and college of San Jos&eacute;, and one
representative each of the professions of medicine and pharmacy, was
convened by royal order, and charged with the duty of ascertaining the
origin and object of the college of San Jos&eacute;, its revenues and
pious charges, and the best manner of installing therein classes of
medicine and pharmacy. The report of the committee was to the effect
that such studies could be admitted. The rector and administrator of
the college in 1869 was of the same opinion, and the rector of the
university of Santo Tom&aacute;s also considered such a thing legal.
November 6, 1870, the Spanish government adopted the decrees concerning
education in the Philippines, known as the Moret decrees,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2195src" href="#xd21e2195" name=
"xd21e2195src">39</a> by which the attempt was made to secularize most
of the institutions of learning. Among other provisions in these
decrees was one <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb133" href="#pb133"
name="pb133">133</a>]</span>directing that the college of San
Jos&eacute;, the college of San Juan de Letran, and the Ateneo
Municipal, as well as the naval academy and the drawing and painting
academy should be united in one academy for secondary and entirely
secular education to be known as the Philippine Institute, to be
subject to the ultimate control of a Superior Board of Education which
was civil and secular in its character. These decrees were never
enforced, for they were vigorously opposed by those in charge of the
above institutions.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2203src" href=
"#xd21e2203" name="xd21e2203src">40</a></p>
<p class="par">In 1875, a royal provision established the faculty of
medicine and pharmacy in the college.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2210src" href="#xd21e2210" name="xd21e2210src">41</a> This
decree, issued October 29, 1875, reorganized the university of Santo
Tom&aacute;s. Article 2 of the decree prescribed &ldquo;that in this
university shall be given the necessary studies for the following:
jurisprudence, canon, medicine, pharmacy, and notary;&rdquo; and
article 12, that, &ldquo;the branches of medicine and pharmacy,
although constituting an integral part of the university, shall be
taught in the college of San Jos&eacute;, whose revenues, with the
deductions of the amounts for pious charges, will be devoted to the
expenses of these branches.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2215src" href=
"#xd21e2215" name="xd21e2215src">42</a> The five-sixths part of the
fees <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb134" href="#pb134" name=

half of the fees for degrees, titles, and certificates of the pupils,
will also pertain to the college mentioned. The rest will pertain to
the general expenses of the university.&rdquo; The governor was to name
a director, upon the recommendation of the rector, for the college, and
he was to have charge of the revenues. September 5, 1877, a commission
appointed to consider various matters of the college of San
Jos&eacute;, recommended that the university of Santo Tom&aacute;s take
immediate charge of all the property of the college, and that
regulations be drawn up for the management of the same. On September
28, of the same year, the governor-general decreed that an
administrative commission consisting of the rector of the university
and the professor of pharmacy should take charge of the college, and
they were given complete authority to carry out the reorganization of
the college decreed in 1875. The report of the commission submitted
July 26, 1878, recommended that the office of director-administrator be
made two separate offices, the office of director to be filled by the
rector of the university of Santo Tom&aacute;s, as director ex-officio,
and that of administrator to be appointed by the governor-general upon
the recommendation of the rector of the university of three names to be
taken from the professions of medicine and pharmacy. This report was
approved August 1 by a decree of the governor-general, which was in
turn approved by royal order of March 24, 1880. The decree of August 1,
1878, charged the rector of the university to prepare regulations
concerning the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb135" href="#pb135" name=
"pb135">135</a>]</span>control and management of the college; and it
appears that such regulations were issued by the governor-general,
October 15, 1879, title 2 of which gives to the rector of the
university, as ex-officio director, the control of properties and
finances of the college. It is said that articles 6&ndash;10 of the
decree of 1875, which directed that competitive examinations be held
either at Manila or Madrid for the filling of vacant professorships,
have not been observed, such vacancies having been filled by the
governor-general on the recommendation of the rector. The
administration of the college properties was kept separate from those
of the university, although the accounts were both under the same
direction of the rector of the university. The scholarships or
fellowships of the college, before twenty in number, were reduced after
1875 to three and transferred to another institution. The income in
normal times was about twenty thousand pesos, the foundation seemingly
being about one-half million in gold.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2230src" href="#xd21e2230" name="xd21e2230src">43</a></p>
<p class="par">With the signing of the treaty of Paris, December 10,
1898, the American government found itself face to face with a delicate
and difficult problem, namely, that of the settlement of the properties
of the friars. Of this problem, the question of the ultimate disposal
of the college of San Jos&eacute; was properly a part, since it was
under the direction of the Dominican university of Santo Tom&aacute;s,
it having become, as we have seen above, the medical and pharmaceutical
adjunct of the university. The question to be solved in this case
narrowed down to whether the college of San Jos&eacute; was primarily a
government or an ecclesiastical <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb136"
href="#pb136" name="pb136">136</a>]</span>pious foundation [<i lang=
"es">obra pia</i>], and hence, whether it could be legally administered
by the government or the Church. In 1899, General Otis forbade the
rector of the university of Santo Tom&aacute;s to continue to maintain
a school of medicine and pharmacy in the buildings of the college of
San Jos&eacute;, and to use its name and income for that
purpose&mdash;an order made at the instance of the president and
directors of the Philippine Medical Association. Shortly after their
arrival the commissioners were consulted by General McArthur, as to the
proper course for him to take on the petition of the rector of the
university asking him to rescind the order. As the issue involved the
question of the control of Church property, the commission deemed it
its duty to investigate it and to bring it to a legal
settlement.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2246src" href="#xd21e2246" name=
"xd21e2246src">44</a></p>
<p class="par">The matter was therefore argued before the Commission,
pro and con, from time to time between July and October, 1900, and the
conclusions announced January 5, 1901. The ecclesiastical authorities
took the position that the college is &ldquo;truly an <i lang="es">obra
pia</i>, that its trusteeship has always been vested in the Church, as
represented by its legal agents either through the Society of Jesus,
the kings of Spain as ecclesiastical patron, the clergy of the
cathedral, or the university of Santo Tom&aacute;s, under the direction
of the archbishop.&rdquo; The ecclesiastical argument is that the
college &ldquo;is essentially a religious foundation and therefore the
United States have not the right to claim it as public property nor to
intervene in its management, since they cannot succeed to the Spanish
ecclesiastical patronage, they having proclaimed the separation of
Church and State.&rdquo; It <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb137" href=
"#pb137" name="pb137">137</a>]</span>is impossible also for the state
to secularize the institution, an act which would be paramount to
confiscation.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2258src" href="#xd21e2258"
name="xd21e2258src">45</a> Archbishop Nozaleda argues also that the
college &ldquo;is an ecclesiastical <i lang="es">obra pia</i>, founded
by Esteban Rodriguez de Figueroa, with all the canonical and civil
formalities demanded by the legislation in force at that time for such
foundation.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2266src" href=
"#xd21e2266" name="xd21e2266src">46</a> Again, he says: &ldquo;The
college of San Jos&eacute; is an ecclesiastical <i lang="es">obra
pia</i>, and as such belongs to the patrimony of the Church.&rdquo; An
ecclesiastical <i lang="es">obra pia</i> he defines as &ldquo;any
foundation made through motives of religious piety, or with the purpose
of exercising Christian charity, with the approbation and authorization
of the bishop.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2278src" href=
"#xd21e2278" name="xd21e2278src">47</a> Against this Dr. T. H. Pardo de
Tavera and others argued before the Philippine Commission that the
college of San Jos&eacute; was primarily of royal foundation;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2283src" href="#xd21e2283" name=
"xd21e2283src">48</a> Felipe G. Calderon, a Filipino advocate, and the
chief adversary of the ecclesiastics, in his pamphlets, also argued
that the college of San Jos&eacute; is official in its origin:<a class=

"xd21e2288src">49</a> their conclusions being that the civil government
has power to intervene in the management of the college.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2294src" href="#xd21e2294" name=
"xd21e2294src">50</a> The commission, being careful not to intimate any
opinion that &ldquo;should be used by either side in the case to be
argued and decided as authority in that tribunal [<i>i.e.</i>, the
Philippine Supreme Court],&rdquo; expressed <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb138" href="#pb138" name=
"pb138">138</a>]</span>&ldquo;no other definitive opinion than that the
petitioners [<i>i.e.</i>, Pardo de Tavera, <i>et al.</i>] have
presented a case of sufficient dignity and seriousness to warrant its
full consideration by a court of justice.&rdquo; In the words of the
commissioners: &ldquo;In order to decide the merits of this case, we
should probably have to consider and settle a nice question of
canonical law, and investigate and discuss the historical and legal
relations of the crown of Spain to the head of the Catholic Church.
Neither of these questions do we feel competent now to decide with the
materials which are before us and with the time at our disposal nor do
we need to do so. We are not a court. We are only a legislative body.
It is our expressly delegated function in just such cases as this to
provide a means for the peaceful and just decision of the issues
arising. Had we been able to decide clearly and emphatically that the
petitioners had no rights here and that their claims were so flimsy as
not to merit the assistance of the legislature in bringing them to
adjudication in a court of justice, we might have properly dismissed
the petition and taken no action thereon; but we are of opinion, all of
us, that the contentions of the petitioners present serious and
difficult questions of law, sufficiently doubtful to require that they
should be decided by a learned and impartial court of competent
jurisdiction, and that it is our duty to make legislative provision for
testing the question. If it be true that the United States is either
itself the trustee to administer these funds, or occupies the relation
of <i lang="la">parens patri&aelig;</i> to them, it becomes its duty to
provide for their administration by a proper directory, whose first
function will be to assert, in the name and authority of the United
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb139" href="#pb139" name=
"pb139">139</a>]</span>States, their right to administer the funds of
the college against the adverse claims of the person now in charge, who
claims to hold under and by virtue of the control over the funds by the
Catholic Church; and this legislative action we now propose to take,
not thereby intimating an opinion upon the merits of the case, but
merely by this means setting in motion the proper machinery for the
ultimate decision by a competent tribunal.&rdquo; The Commission set
aside $5,000 in United States money for the payment of the expenses of
getting evidence, preparing the record, printing the briefs, and as
fees for professional services; and that the case was to be heard
before the Philippine Supreme Court, the United States being
practically a party in the litigation. Further provision was made in
case appeals from that court were to be made to the Supreme Court of
the United States, for Congress to so provide in this case. As to the
injunctive order of General Otis against the opening of the college, by
the rector of the university, it was recommended to the military
governor that it be rescinded. The persons appointed to conduct the
litigation and to take charge of the college and its estates, should
the decision and a decree of the court be in their favor, were as
follows: Dr. T. H. Pardo de Tavera; Dr. Charles R. Greenleaf, Leon M.
Guerrero, Dr. Manuel Gomez Martinez, and Dr. Frank S. Bourns. The
concluding remarks of the Commission are the following: &ldquo;There
has been much popular and political interest in the controversy in
which we have now stated our conclusions. The questions considered,
however, have not had any political color at all. They have been purely
questions of law and proper legal procedure, and so will <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href="#pb140" name="pb140">140</a>]</span>they
be in the court to which they are now sent. The decision of the right
to control San Jos&eacute; college cannot legitimately be affected by
the political feeling which one may have for or against the friars. It
is unfortunate that the public should clothe the settlement of an issue
purely legal with political significance when it ought not to have and
does not have one. But, however this may be, those charged with
settling it can pursue only one path, and that is the path of legal
right as they see it.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2320src" href=

Garcia. It was formed from six students on St. Francis&rsquo;s day,
1600. So many people soon joined that it became necessary to split the
congregation into two parts, one of students and the other of laymen,
the latter of which had one hundred members in two years. Their objects
were charity and devotion. The first to initiate the congregations of
the Virgin in the Jesuit order was Juan de Le&oacute;n, a Flemish

document in the <span lang="es">Archivo-historico Nacional</span>,
Madrid, bearing pressmark, A. 18&ndash;26&ndash;8, from the archbishop
of the Philippines, Basilio Sancho de Santa Justa y Santa Rufina, dated
Manila, January 1, 1770, is as follows: &ldquo;Sire: Although I have
recounted to your Majesty <i lang="la">in extenso</i> the measures
which I have considered most suitable for the erection of a general
conciliar seminary for all these most excellent islanders, and of such
seminary being in the college called San Joseph which was under the
charge of the now expelled Jesuits, provided that I could incline the
superior government of these islands to allow me to go ahead with it,
until your Majesty ordered otherwise; and although hitherto seventy and
more seminarists have been supported in this college, which is elevated
to a seminary <i lang="la">ad interim</i>, who are being reared and
canons for the exercise of the parish ministry, in addition to the not
small number of those who have already gone forth from it to occupy
themselves in that ministry, with manifest profit even in the short
space of two years since its creation: yet although today, according to
the new measures and plan approved by your Majesty for the
fortification of this place, it is indispensable to demolish, if not
entirely, yet in a very considerable part, the above-mentioned college,
since its location is next the walls and in a district where, as it is
more suitable and better defended, the principal gate of this city is
to be opened; and in order that there may be an open and free passage
to it, as it is the place of most traffic and trade, nothing else can
be done than to level the site occupied by the said college. On this
account, the grace which I have implored from your Majesty will be
frustrated. In consideration of this, I have recourse a second time to
the charity of your Majesty, and humbly petition, that since the
college called San Ygnacio is left alone in this city, which belonged
also to the above-mentioned expelled ones, that your Majesty will deign
to admit my first petition as it was directed for this end; or should
it, perchance, be your royal pleasure that the said college of San
Ygnacio become a public university, which has been, until the present,
maintained in the college of Santo Thomas, under the direction of the
religious of Santo Domingo, those religious passing to the college of
San Ygnacio because of its greater size and its better arrangement for
a public university, and that of Santo Thomas be used as a conciliar
seminary. The consideration that the college of Santo Thomas, besides
being suitable for a seminary, is almost at the very doors of this holy
church, and, consequently, best suited for the assistance of the
seminarists at the choir and functions of the altar, moves me to this
petition. May God our Lord preserve the holy Catholic person of your
Majesty the many years that I petition, and that Christendom finds
necessary.&rdquo;&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

<p class="par"><i>Of the honorable apostolic and royal erection of the
University of Santo Tom&aacute;s of Manila</i></p>
<p class="par">Another and very serious matter was transacted by that
religious father, namely, the erection into a university of the college
of Santo Tom&aacute;s of Manila. That event is as follows. While that
venerable father, Fray Juan Bautista de Morales, was in Roma during the
years 1643 and 1644, negotiating matters touching the province, as its
procurator, and the matters of China, father Fray Mateo de la Villa,
who was also procurator of the province in that capital, wrote him from
Madrid asking him to petition from his Holiness, Urban Eighth, who was
then head of the Church, for the erection and foundation as a
university in said college of Santo Tom&aacute;s of Manila. He had
gained for that purpose a favorable letter from his Majesty, Filipo
Fourth the Great, our king and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb142"
href="#pb142" name="pb142">142</a>]</span>sovereign, in which his
Holiness was asked to deign to concede his apostolic bull for that
purpose. Father Fray Juan made his efforts, but by reason of all the
matters and accidents which happened at that time, it was not
accomplished. Consequently, he went to Espa&ntilde;a without
negotiating it that said year of 44. In that year, on the last day of
July, the pontiff Urban Eighth, passed to the better life. Innocent
Tenth having been elected September 15 of the same year, another letter
was obtained from the king, our sovereign Filipo Fourth, for his
Holiness. Since father Fray Victorio Riccio, a Florentine who had come
[to Espa&ntilde;a] in order to go to this province, was in Madrid, and
was a very suitable person since he was an Italian, to be entrusted
with that and other matters which were left pending in Roma by father
Fray Juan, it was thought best to send him thither. He accomplished
that as well as the other things, which have been continued in the
service of the order and of this province. He is a great missionary of
China, of whom this history will tell at the proper time the many
things that there are to tell, for at present he is prior of the
convent of Santo Domingo in Manila. The letter of his Majesty to the
supreme pontiff Innocent is as follows:</p>

<p class="par">The said father Fray Victorio went to Roma with that
letter, and although it reached the hands of his Holiness, yet he could
not obtain that haste which he desired, for the ambassador was in
disgrace with the pope because of some trouble which he had had
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb145" href="#pb145" name=
"pb145">145</a>]</span>with certain Portuguese which cost blood and
deaths. His Holiness was very angry at that trouble, and it was
necessary for the ambassador to leave Roma. But the father, not losing
courage, as he had many powerful friends in that capital, as he had
been raised there and had started for Filipinas from Minerva, exerted
himself and obtained the opportunity to pay his respects to his
Holiness and to lay his proposition before him, to which the pontiff
answered in formal words: &ldquo;In the time of our predecessor the
same instance was made by the king of Espa&ntilde;a, but it was not
granted. How now do they return to insist again?&rdquo; And it was so
that the first letter of his Majesty was brought, and that benefit
which was striven for was not obtained on account of the occupations
and for other reasons which his Holiness must have had (in which the
great providence of God in the government of the holy oracles of His
vicars is to be noted, since a pontiff worthy of adoration had so
singular an idea of Filipinas and of the university which was requested
there) although the father left disconsolate. But by direction of a
cardinal, his fellow countryman the father again renewed his courage,
and, after waiting several months, again paid his respects to his
Holiness, and gave him a memorial of his desire. His Holiness caused it
to be received by his secretary, and the next day it was taken to the
signatura,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2376src" href="#xd21e2376" name=
"xd21e2376src">2</a> and a decree was made that in regard to the
erection of this university, a committee [<i lang=
"es">congregacion</i>] of four cardinals and four prelates named there
should be formed. The president of it was the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb146" href="#pb146" name="pb146">146</a>]</span>most
eminent Cardinal Saqueti, the father&rsquo;s countryman who had aided
him from the beginning. The said prelates informed, then, and visited
by the father, and being informed of the advisability of what was
asked, it was concluded in the said committee that it was fitting to
concede that favor to the king of Espa&ntilde;a. Therefore, his
Holiness despatched his apostolic bull in regard to this erection, that
bull being as follows:</p>
<p class="par">[This bull<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2391src" href=
"#xd21e2391" name="xd21e2391src">3</a> will be found in <span class=
"sc">VOL. XXXV</span>, pp. 203&ndash;208.]</p>
<p class="par">This brief was presented to the royal Council of the
Indias, and the gentlemen of that council having read it, ordered a
testimony of its presentation to be given July 28, 1646. That was
attested on the thirty-first of the same month by Diego Lopez de
Leytona y Mendoza, chief official of the papers of grace, government,
and war, of the secretary&rsquo;s office of the royal Council of the
Indias for the district of Nueva Espa&ntilde;a. The fact that he was
also the chief official <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb147" href=
"#pb147" name="pb147">147</a>]</span>of the said royal Council, and
that credit must be given to him, was testified by the royal notaries,
Diego Carre&ntilde;o Aldrete, and Antonio Gomez, on the said
thirty-first of July of the said year. Likewise, the said brief was
presented, and the testimony of its presentation, in the royal Council
of the Indias before the members of the royal Audiencia of this city of
Manila. They having read it, determined that the party of the
university of Santo Tom&aacute;s could make use of the said brief.
Consequently, they so voted by an act on the eighth of July, 1648, of
which testimony was given on the said day by Captain Diego Nu&ntilde;ez
Crespo, assembly clerk of the said royal Audiencia of Manila. Likewise,
the said brief was presented before the dean and cabildo of this holy
metropolitan church of Manila with the said presentations of the royal
Council and Audiencia. The said gentlemen considered it as presented,
and allowed the college of Santo Tom&aacute;s to make use of it, and
its rector, now or in the future, in the form and manner which is
contained in the said bull. The clerk of the cabildo, Fernando de
Caravajal, attested that on the same day on which the said act was
voted, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb148" href="#pb148" name=
"pb148">148</a>]</span>namely, July 14, 1648. This university having
been inaugurated, then, and erected with so great honor into a
pontifical and royal institution, its rector and first chancellor,
namely, father Fray Martin Real de la Cruz, by virtue of his apostolic
authority, made the necessary statutes, following in them all the
custom and practice of the royal university of Mexico (of which from
its beginning it has esteemed itself as the close daughter, and in
which it has found the just functions of a noble mother with the
exchange of letters and favors which the latter has given to it). Thus
the said father rector ordained them, August 28, 1648, and they are
observed inviolably and are like those of the said their royal and
always noble mother, which were determined after the style and form of
the most celebrated university of Salamanca.</p>
<p class="par">In 1651 this university and its rector wrote to the said
university of Mexico giving an account of its erection, stating that in
it was born their obligation of attentive respect as daughter of that
royal university, since the king our sovereign had given that
university to it as mother and mistress. Consequently, it yielded and
dedicated itself to that university and in regard to this the father
concluded his letter with all due consideration and affection. In the
year of 53, that most noble and ever famous university wrote this our
university the following letter, which was written in full
cloister.</p>
<p class="par">Very illustrious Sirs:</p>
<p class="par">This royal university of Mexico was greatly favored by
the letter of your Lordship the past year of 51, in which was expressed
the appreciation and estimation which is right and which is fitting for

that royal university as its crown and glory, and as such will venerate
it forever. It will give his Majesty (whom may God preserve) thanks for
the favors which he concedes to your Lordship by his decree of the
rights to enjoy the privileges which are enjoyed in this royal
university. What may be necessary for it, in so far as documents and
papers are concerned, and for the pretension of your Lordship, will be
delivered to the reverend father master, Fray Francisco de la Trinidad,
so that we may carry them and present them to his Majesty in his royal
Council of the Indias. In all the other things which may offer
themselves for the service of your Lordship for its greater luster and
increase, this royal university and its entire cloister will assist it
with all promptness. May God preserve your Lordship in all happiness,
etc. Mexico, February 7, 1653. <span class="sc">Master Fray Juan de

all that luster worthy of all estimation, has continued to advance.

by his Holiness, Innocent X, in the year one thousand six hundred and
forty-five,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2450src" href="#xd21e2450" name=

its obligation in the public instruction with well-known benefit to
those vassals, in which the religious have filled the chairs at the
expense of the private property of the above-mentioned college, but
also, at the same time, in order to inspire in the minds of its pupils

and noble proofs that attest this truth is the promptness, with which
the present rector, Fray Domingo Collantes, in this last war, in
observance of the suggestion of that governor, raised four companies of
fifty soldiers apiece among the collegiates and students, on whose
clothing and support he spent some thousands of pesos from the
beginning of the war until the peace was made, and at the same time
placing at the disposition of the same government all the grain of the
harvest and the cattle of its estates&mdash;and inasmuch as he has
petitioned me that, in order that this signal example of the fidelity
and generosity with which the above-named college served me and
continues to serve me, may be remembered by the inhabitants of those
islands, I deign to signify to it my royal pleasure and kindness by
admitting it under my sovereign protection and patronage, and by
granting to it the title of &ldquo;very loyal;&rdquo; therefore, my
Council of the Indias having examined the above petition, together with
the information given in regard to it by the general accountant&rsquo;s
office, and the explanation of my fiscal, I have resolved in the
conference of the tenth of January of this year, to concede, among
other things, and as I concede by this my royal decree, the sole name

Fernandez Arias, from his <i lang="es">Discurso leido en la apertura de

opening of its studies (of the university) July 2, 1885&rdquo; (Manila,
1885). Its author was a professor of the university.]</p>
<p class="par">The university of Santo Tom&aacute;s, of Manila, graced
with the titles of royal and pontifical by the Catholic <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb153" href="#pb153" name=
"pb153">153</a>]</span>kings and the supreme pontiffs, holds the first
place among all the educational institutions of the Philippines on
account of its antiquity, its history, and its importance. It was
established in 1619, under the name of College of Santo Tom&aacute;s,
having, as its basis, a holy legacy from his Excellency, Fray Miguel de
Benavides, of the Order of Preachers, second archbishop of Manila, who
is considered as its true founder. By this legacy, the sum of 1,600
pesos was turned over to the fathers of his order, of the province of
the Sant&iacute;simo Rosario, who, accepting it, in accordance with his
purposes and intentions, immediately proceeded to carry the plan into
effect. Thus, after various contingencies, on the day of the festival
of the Assumption of the Virgin, in the year mentioned, after having
been authorized by the general government of these islands, and by both
the ecclesiastical and the secular chapters, Fray Baltasar Fort, its
first rector, proceeded to the inauguration of its studies by giving
fellowships to twelve young men belonging to the most distinguished
families of Manila. The permission granted by the general government
and other authorities of this capital, was formally confirmed by his
Catholic Majesty, Felipe IV, in his royal decree of November 29, 1623,
in which he said of this institution: &ldquo;It has afforded and
affords great advantages to the young, the preaching of the gospel, and
the instruction of the children of the inhabitants.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The chronicles of those times show that the number of
young men, mostly children of Spaniards, who attended the schools of
the Dominican fathers was not small; but the difficulty of not being
able to receive academic degrees was an obstacle to the progress
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb154" href="#pb154" name=
"pb154">154</a>]</span>of the studies. For this reason, Pope Paul V was
asked to authorize the order to confer the customary degrees upon the
pupils of this college. This permission was granted for ten years, upon
the expiration of which time, it was necessary to again apply to the
Roman pontiff, then Urban VIII, for the extension of the concession for
a similar term of years. This uncertain condition of affairs was not,
as is evident, most conducive to progress in these studies, for which
reason Felipe IV, desiring to regulate this concession consistently and
permanently, requested, through his ambassador, an apostolic brief from
the supreme pontiff, Innocent X, in 1645, which should confer upon the
college of Santo Tom&aacute;s (the title) and honors of a university,
with all the privileges of those of the same class in the Peninsula,
authorizing it to confer academic degrees in the schools of theology
and philosophy. Afterwards, in 1734, this concession was extended by
Clement XII,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2509src" href="#xd21e2509"
name="xd21e2509src">8</a> also on the petition of the king of Spain, to
the schools of canonical and civil law, and to others that might in
time be established.</p>
<p class="par">The year following the erection of this university by
Innocent X and Felipe IV, its first rector and chancellor, Fray Martin
Real de la Cruz, who so distinguished himself in the conversion of the
Cagayanes, framed the laws, which continued in force until 1785. The
greater part of these were similar to the laws of the university of
Mexico, to which his Catholic Majesty desired to conform them, as
appears from his letter written on December 20, 1644, to his ambassador
at Rome.</p>
<p class="par">In the beginning the only courses were dogmatic
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb155" href="#pb155" name=
"pb155">155</a>]</span>and moral theology, philosophy, and the
humanities; Latin and Spanish grammar, rhetoric, and poetry were
included in the humanities, and the study of all the branches comprised
in the works of Santo Tom&aacute;s de Aquino formed a part of the
courses in theology and philosophy.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2521src"
href="#xd21e2521" name="xd21e2521src">9</a> This was the custom in most
of the universities existing at that time, a custom that responded
perfectly to the necessities of that century, and more particularly to
the special requirements of this country at that period. In the first
stage of their civilization, education in the Philippines was based
exclusively on religion; and the local necessities and the aspirations
of the first Spaniards, echoing faithfully the sentiments expressed
many times concerning this subject by the Catholic monarchs, demanded a
literary center where the bishops and missionaries might find a
solution for the many and varied doubts which arose in the exercise of
their ministry; where the governors-general might receive ideas of
profound and consistent methods of government for the direction of the
towns and for their relations with neighboring nations, and where the
alcaldes and encomenderos might learn the lessons of Christian charity
and justice, which they not infrequently failed to observe. In what a
satisfactory manner the university of Santo Tom&aacute;s fulfilled this
duty is shown by the illustrious names of Fathers Berart, Marron, Santa
Cruz, Pardo, Sanchez, and the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb156"
href="#pb156" name="pb156">156</a>]</span>celebrated Father Paz, and
many others whom it would take too long to mention, whose brilliant and
wise writings contain discussions of all kinds regarding the practical
life of these people. It is also shown by the royal decree of 1862, in
which his Catholic Majesty, admitting this institution under his
protection, says that degrees in theology and letters are given with
all strictness and display to qualified persons in those islands, this
being of notable utility in that it furnishes subjects capable of
filling the offices of curates and prebendaries.</p>
<p class="par">The eighteenth century arrived, and, with the coming of
the Bourbon dynasty to the Spanish throne, new germs of civilization
took root throughout the monarchy, and were felt as far as these remote
shores. Then the faculty of jurisprudence and canonical law was
established (the establishment of which the Dominican corporation had
endeavored to secure years before), because with the increase of the
native and mestizo population, and with the consolidation upon a
religious basis of the social life of these peoples, there was not a
sufficient number of lawyers for the administration of justice. Lawyers
did not come from the Peninsula, and for that reason, if not for other
better and more noble reasons, it was necessary to seek them within the
bounds of the islands. Hence, faculties of jurisprudence and canonical
law were established, with courses in Roman law and institutes and the
sacred canons. The pupils could hope for the degree of licentiate in
jurisprudence and canonical law after a four years&rsquo; course in
these studies, and four other years called <i lang=
"es">pasant&iacute;a</i> years, which were taken in connection with the
law course, and were years of practice in the office of some
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb157" href="#pb157" name=
"pb157">157</a>]</span>lawyer. During these so-called <i lang=
"es">pasant&iacute;a</i> years, the pupils were required to defend a
proposition every week and sum up the opposing arguments, and were
permitted to act as substitutes during the absence of any of the
professors of the faculty.</p>
<p class="par">The course of institutes and canonical law was the only
course in law given in most of the universities of that period, the
professors being charged with making the applications necessary to the
Spanish laws and those of the Indias, explaining the points in which
they differed from the Roman and canonical laws.</p>
<p class="par">The instruction continued thus during the greater part
of the eighteenth century, the university conferring degrees in
theology, philosophy, and canonical and Roman law. The courses in moral
theology and the humanities were pursued without the formalities of
enrolment and without a fixed number of terms, until toward the end of
that century. With the increase of the commerce and the intercourse of
these islands with Europe, and under the influence of the government of
Carlos III, it was decided in the university assembly of 1785, to
extend the faculty of theology by the establishment of chairs in
literature and sacred writings, and that of law by two additional
chairs of canonical and Roman law. It was also decided to create the
faculty of medicine, together with a chair of mathematics, applied to
commerce and navigation in conformity with the necessities of the
times. Father Amador, professor of canonical law, having been appointed
to form the new laws, in accordance with the resolution of the
assembly, concluded them during the same year, 1785. These laws, after
being approved by the superior government <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb158" href="#pb158" name="pb158">158</a>]</span>of these islands, are
now in force except in the points modified by subsequent laws. These
laws provided that all professorships, with the exception of those
belonging to the private patronage of the Order of St. Dominic, should
be conferred by competitive examinations. It also prescribed rules for
the conferring of academic degrees by the faculties of theology,
canons, law, philosophy, and the new one of medicine, it being provided
that, in order to secure the degree of bachelor of theology, canons,
civil law, and medicine, it was necessary to have passed in four
courses, and for philosophy in three, and that, after having obtained
the title of bachelor, it was necessary to exercise the <i lang=
"es">pasant&iacute;a</i> for four years in the schools of theology and
law, and for three years in the other schools. Rules werealso provided
for the courses, the enrolments, and the examination fees. These laws
were taken to a great extent from those in force in the universities of
Salamanca, Mexico, and Lima.</p>
<p class="par">About that time the king of Spain confirmed the
privilege of exemption from tribute for all those who had received the
degree of bachelor, and also for the pupils of the university, in
consideration of &ldquo;the utility and necessity for this branch of
the state to encourage these studies, without which no community can
flourish; for, if it should be ordered, contrary to the practice
observed up to the present time, that the tribute be paid, the schools
would be deserted, to the general injury of these islands.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Because of the indolence of the times and the lack of
pupils, it became necessary to abolish the school of medicine and the
class of mathematics and drawing, which were afterwards incorporated by
the <i lang="es">consulado</i>, and the superior studies continued
during <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb159" href="#pb159" name=
"pb159">159</a>]</span>the first part of the present century as they
existed at the beginning of the eighteenth century. It was not until
the year 1836, on the petition of the corporation of St. Dominic, that
the chair of Spanish law was created, increasing the faculty of
laws.</p>
<p class="par">By a royal order of 1837, continuing the progressive
course initiated in the instruction at the university, a commission,
presided over by the director of the university, was appointed for the
purpose of studying the method of extending the instruction, and making
a report upon the manner of filling the chairs which should be created,
at the same time preparing a plan of studies, conforming as far as
possible with that in force in the Peninsula. The report of this
commission was awaiting the decision of the court of appeals when a new
royal order of April 2, 1842, provided for the appointment of a new
commission, also presided over by the director of the university, and
consisting of one associate justice of the royal court of appeals, a
prebendary of the cathedral chapter, a member of the municipal council,
and one of the economic association, for the purpose of preparing a new
plan of studies in harmony with the necessities of the times. The new
commission, having worked with great activity, presented its completed
report, submitting a plan of laws for this university which included
the college of San Jos&eacute;, notwithstanding the opposition of its
rector, who, as prebendary, formed part of the commission. According to
this plan of studies, instruction in theology, philosophy, and
jurisprudence was improved, chairs of medicine, pharmacy, and chemistry
were created, and that of physics was extended. Upon the submission of
this plan of studies to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb160" href=
"#pb160" name="pb160">160</a>]</span>supreme government of his Majesty,
it was provided by another royal order of April 2, 1846, that funds be
secured for the establishment of said change in the university, without
injuring the interests of anybody, but respecting those existing in so
far as possible.</p>
<p class="par">In fulfilment of this decree, on the twenty-sixth of the
following August, this superior government appointed another
commission, to which was communicated a royal order of April 15, 1847,
which appointed, as a member of the same, the rector and chancellor of
the university; and another royal order of July 12, of the same year,
which directed said commission not to include in the budget of studies
&ldquo;the property of the college of Santo Tom&aacute;s, as it is the
exclusive property of the Dominican fathers.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e2565src" href="#xd21e2565" name="xd21e2565src">10</a>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb161" href="#pb161" name=
"pb161">161</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Unfortunately this commission was dissolved just before
the completion of its work, on account of the absence of some members
in the Peninsula, there remaining only one (in addition to the rector
of the university), who later resigned his membership in the
commission, under date of October 28, 1848. But by a royal order of
April 19, 1849, the action of this superior government in not accepting
said resignation was approved, and in the place of the absent members,
Se&ntilde;or Montes de Oca was appointed and instructions given that
another competent person should associate with them, in order that the
work of university reform might continue. But as the commission did not
hasten the matter with the speed desired by the government of his
Majesty, another royal order was issued, under date of October 19,
1852, urging the commission to conclude the plan, and budget of
studies, in accordance with the wishes and the interest of his Majesty
for the welfare and prosperity of this colony. However, the difficulty
of reconciling very great extremes, such as the preservation, in a new
plan of studies, of everything already in existence that should be in
harmony with the studies of the universities of Spain, the formation of
a budget without injuring the interests of anyone, and a thousand other
necessary considerations, placed under the charge of the commission by
more than one royal decree, were more than sufficient causes to prevent
the board from finishing its laborious contract and including its
complicated work in the brief period desired. Hence, it was not until
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb162" href="#pb162" name=
"pb162">162</a>]</span>February 16, 1856, that its work was done, and
the long-desired plan of studies concluded. This plan was at once sent
to the superior government of these islands, in order that it might
finally be forwarded when it should be deemed convenient. The papers
were still in the hands of the secretary of the government in March,
1859, when a fire occurred in the town of San Miguel, where said
secretary resided at the time, and unfortunately the papers, in the
compilation of which so much valuable labor had been expended, were
burned. So unfortunate an occurrence must naturally have delayed this
matter, although by chance there was in the possession of the rector of
the university a copy of all these works and the previous writings of
the board which were used in the compilation of the desired plan. The
rector of the university was requested by the government of these
islands to furnish all the previous writings in his possession on the
works and plan of studies which had been destroyed while in the
possession of the secretary, and which should serve as a basis for the
new papers treating of the same subject.</p>
<p class="par">But before sending the report to his Majesty, for his
final approval, the superior government received some copies of the
plan of studies newly established in the universities of the Peninsula,
together with a royal order directing that it be adapted in so far as
possible to the plan for these islands which was to be presented for
the approbation of his Majesty. This circumstance led to the suspension
of the proceedings instituted, and obliged this superior government to
appoint another commission, or, rather, to complete the old one, which
had already become disintegrated by the absence of some of its members,
to revise the work and the plan of studies formerly proposed, and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb163" href="#pb163" name=
"pb163">163</a>]</span>to harmonize it, if possible, with the plan of
studies, a copy of which was sent to the members of the board for the
purpose indicated.</p>
<p class="par">Thus, on April 5, 1861, General Lemery appointed the
lacking members of said commission, in which figured, as in the former
commissions, the director and chancellor of this university. The
commission concluded its work on February 20, 1862. The plan of studies
prepared by this last commission was presented on the same day to the
superior government of the islands and was finally transmitted with a
favorable report to the government of his Majesty without the sovereign
approval for its establishment having as yet been given.</p>
<p class="par">This lack of approval of the superior government did not
prevent the consideration of the means of immediately carrying into
effect the change in the studies, and soon afterwards, in 1865,
secondary instruction was adopted with the degree of bachelor of arts,
commercial expert, and surveyor, and chemical and industrial expert, as
in the universities of the Peninsula. The classes were opened the
following year, in accordance with a provisional program taken from
that of Cuba. In 1867, this program was given the supreme approval.
Secondary instruction having been happily inaugurated, the approval of
the plan of superior instruction, submitted by the university to the
government of his Majesty, was being awaited, when a decree arrived
from the regent of the kingdom, Don Francisco Serrano, countersigned by
the colonial minister, Se&ntilde;or Moret,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2586src" href="#xd21e2586" name="xd21e2586src">11</a> which
secularized the official studies, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb164"
href="#pb164" name="pb164">164</a>]</span>and, suppressing the existing
colleges and the universities of Santo Tom&aacute;s, converted them
into the Philippine Institute and the university of the Philippines
respectively, thus ignoring all the elements which they had accumulated
in their teaching during three centuries of existence, and turning over
the literary future of the people to the hazardous plan, inspired,
notwithstanding the loyal patriotism of the minister, by a doctrine
diametrically opposed to that which had served as a solid basis for
welfare and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb165" href="#pb165" name=
"pb165">165</a>]</span>progress. The corporations of Manila, the
bishops, and the clergy, with a majority of the householders, protested
against a measure which, although it fulfilled the hopes of the
university in regard to new chairs and schools, deprived them of any
value by separating them completely from the religious basis. These
protests were heard by the governor of these islands, Se&ntilde;or
Izquierdo, who provisionally resolved that the decree be not executed
in regard to the secularization, but that it be carried out with regard
to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href="#pb166" name=
"pb166">166</a>]</span>the new schools. This resolution was fully
approved by the government of the Peninsula. Thus, in 1871, the schools
of medicine and pharmacy were established, and the other schools were
extended. By a resolution of General Moriones, the governor of these
islands, which was confirmed by his Catholic Majesty, it was decided to
appoint a director of the college of San Jos&eacute;, which was granted
in perpetuity to the rector of the university, and of an administrator,
on the recommendation of the said director, for the management of
revenues.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2605src" href="#xd21e2605" name=
"xd21e2605src">12</a></p>
<p class="par">In 1876, the study of the profession of notary was
inaugurated, and two professors were appointed to teach these subjects.
Finally, in 1879 and 1880, the auxiliary courses of medicine and
pharmacy, midwives, assistant surgeons, and practitioners in pharmacy
were created. From this date, the university of Manila has had a
complete course of superior and secondary instruction, better than some
universities of the Peninsula.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2613src"

in the college of Santo Tom&aacute;s of the Order of St. Dominic at
Manila, in which portions of Innocent&rsquo;s bull are inserted. This

&ldquo;Clement XII Pope. In future remembrance of the affair. Long ago

<p class="par footnote">&ldquo;Since moreover, as has been represented
to us lately on the part of our very dear son in Christ, Philip, also
Catholic King of the same Spains, in the academy or university of
general study of the said college, two new chairs have been erected,

college of Santo Tom&aacute;s, the report of the Dominican friars in
1883 to the colonial exposition of Amsterdam says: &ldquo;The building
occupied by the university of Santo Tom&aacute;s has contained since
1611 the college of the same name, which is under the direction of the
Dominican friars, who gratuitously educate therein from 30 to 40
youths, the children of poor families, generally providing all the
expenses for their career, and preparing them so that in the future
they can fill an unembarrassed and suitable place in society. Many of
these youths have become distinguished in scientific circles, and for
their honesty in the legal profession, while others have been honored
with the miter of a bishop, and have occupied venerable positions in
ecclesiastical chapters. The youths educated in this college were not
only Spaniards, but included also natives and mestizos, some of whom
entered as servants, which was an honor solicited by many; and on some
occasions four large dormitories of this college have been completely
filled. There was a period when some entered and paid a moderate
amount, according to the archives in the college, but this period was a
very short one, because the documents on file in the archives show that
at the beginning and at the middle of the seventeenth century, and
during a greater part of the eighteenth century, no free pupils were
admitted, and the few who were admitted paid a moderate tuition fee in
proportion to the means of the family. In the beginning the only
branches of secondary instruction taught in the college were the
so-called philological or grammatical studies, and after proficiency
therein any of the careers established in the university was
followed.&rdquo; See <i>Census of Philippines</i>, iii, pp. 596,

Moret decree, Tom&aacute;s G. del Rosario, writing on education in the
Philippines, in <i>Census of Philippines</i>, iii, p. 637, says:
&ldquo;This decree, countersigned by the eminent colonial minister, Don
Segismundo Moret, introducing modern advances in Philippine
legislation, secularizing instruction and giving it all kinds of
guarantees and liberties, this long-awaited provision, caused a great
outburst of enthusiasm throughout the archipelago, as it signified the
manumission of the popular conscience from a slavery bound with the
chains of fanaticism and inimical irreconcilability. In many provinces
and in the city of Manila, this never-to-be-forgotten resolution of the
Spanish government was received with signs of evident joy. Later, under
various pretexts, all those who had expressed joy were cruelly
persecuted, and put in jail, or deported as insurgents, masons,
filibusters, etc., these measures extending even to those who were
merely suspected. This is the history of all theocratic or despotic
governments. It is true that some residents and parents of families
protested against this provision, together with the corporations, the
bishops, and the clergy, but these residents and fathers of families
did so either through fear or because they were debtors to or members
of the families of the friars. Some did so for fear of being
discovered, but most of them to carry out ambitions; no one made a
protest with sincerity and in good faith. Everything was hypocrisy, as
is the case, and must be the case, among all nations oppressed by
absolutism.&rdquo; R. L. Packard&rsquo;s article, &ldquo;Education in
Cuba, Porto Rico, and the Philippines&rdquo; included in the <i>Report
of the Commissioner of Education</i> 1897&ndash;98, i, pp.
909&ndash;983, gives (pp. 976, 977), the plan of studies of the Moret
decree of November 6, which is as follows: Spanish and Latin grammar;
elements of rhetoric and poetry; elements of physical geography;
elements of descriptive geography in general and the Philippines in
particular; universal history&mdash;history of Spain and the Philippine
Islands; arithmetic and algebra; geometry and plane trigonometry;
elements of physics and chemistry and of natural history; psychology,
logic, and moral philosophy; general outline of anatomy, physiology,
and hygiene. The studies for the industrial profession included:
mercantile arithmetic; bookkeeping and accounts; political economy and
mercantile and industrial legislation; geography and commercial
statistics; French, English, Tag&aacute;log, and Visayan; surveying;
spherical trigonometry; cosmography, pilotage, and maneuvers;
theoretical and applied mechanics; physics and chemistry applied to the
arts; topographical drawing and hydrography; lineal and ornamental
drawing&mdash;landscape, figures, and painting. The university of Santo
Tom&aacute;s, which changed its title to that of the university of the
Philippines by this decree was organized as to its faculties of law and
medicine, and the latter contained the following studies: descriptive
and general anatomy, two courses; exercises in osteology and
dissection, two courses; physiology, one course; public and private
hygiene, one course; general pathology, with clinics and pathological
anatomy, one course; therapeutics, materia medica, and writing
prescriptions, one course; surgical pathology, with operations,
bandaging, etc., one course; medical pathology, one course; obstetrics
and special pathology of women and children, with clinics, one course;
medical and surgical clinics, two courses; legal and toxicological
medicine, one course. The pharmaceutical course was also reorganized by
this decree. The same minister had proposed October 2, 1870,
&ldquo;that instruction should be given at the university of Madrid in
Tag&aacute;log and other studies which would give information about the
Philippines and the English and Dutch East India possessions and their
methods of government, especially for the benefit of those who intended
to enter the colonial service.&rdquo; December 5, 1870, in an
exposition of the history, conditions, and needs of public instruction
in the Philippines, he recites the early activity of the Augustinians,
Dominicans, and Jesuits, in education. He points out that by the
process of absorption by the religious orders, education became
concentrated in their hands, and while they had done much good in early
times, their narrowness and conservatism rendered secularization of
instruction necessary.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

the defects inherent in the plan of instruction which the friars
developed in the Philippines. It suited their plans that scientific and
literary knowledge should not become general nor be very extensive, for
which reason they took but little interest in the study of those
subjects or in the quality of the instruction. Their educational
establishments were places of luxury for the children of wealthy and
well-to-do families, rather than establishments in which to perfect and
develop the minds of Filipino youth. It is true that they were careful
to give them a religious education, tending to make them respect the
omnipotent power of the monastic corporations, at least three
certificates being required every year, proving that the pupil had gone

courses of study for the schools of jurisprudence, theology, and
canons, medicine, pharmacy, and the notarial profession, in accordance
with the royal decree of October 29, 1875, and the studies given in the
school for practitioners in medicine and practitioners in pharmacy,
approved by the general government of the Philippines on March 4, and
December 29, 1879, and afterward confirmed by the supreme government,
in <i>Census of Philippines</i>, iii, pp. 627&ndash;629. A course was
also given under the same authority for midwives. According to a
Dominican report submitted at the Exposition of Madrid, in 1887, the
university of Santo Tom&aacute;s conferred degrees upon 957 bachelors,
132 licentiates, and 97 doctors in philosophy, theology, canonical law,
and civil law from 1645 to 1820. The graduations from 1820 to 1850 were
as follows: theology, 457; canons, 325; institute, 748; civil law, 203;
philosophy, 2,173. From 1850 to 1870, the graduations were: theology,
822; Roman and canonical law, 1,540; civil law, 658; philosophy, 3,405.
The graduations from 1871 to 1886 were as follows: preparatory course
in theology and jurisprudence, 745; preparatory course in pharmacy and
medicine, 660; dogmatic theology, 406; moral theology, 104; canonical
law, 36; jurisprudence, 1,904; pharmacy, 356; medicine, 1,029. The
report of 1887 contains the following in regard to the university:
&ldquo;The university of Manila has the titles of royal and pontifical,
which reveal its glorious destiny of propagating in this archipelago
religion and love for Spain. It is under the most special patronage of
the angelical doctor [<i>i.e.</i>, St. Thomas Aquinas], presenting in
its name of royal and pontifical university of Santo Tom&aacute;s the
ideals which have prompted its foundation and directed its development
for a period of almost three centuries. Its organization is simple
without being rudimentary. Having for a basis religious education, at
the same time that it avoids the danger of professors expounding more
or less advanced theories, which in practice sooner or later, are
reduced to moral ruins, both public and private, it contains the pupil
within the circle of a severe discipline, in which, if some apparently
see oppression and a suppression of spirit, this apparent oppression is
softened by the paternal affection which the priests in charge of the
instruction know how to bestow upon the natives of this archipelago. A
constant encouragement to the young, directed by prudent and
affectionate discipline; that is the standard observed by the
university of Manila as to its pupils.&rdquo; It was impossible for the
friars to extend this purely religious education to university studies,
as the persons devoting themselves to such studies were already adult
persons. Graduates from the university, although officially recognized
by the Spanish government, rarely received official aid. The few
Filipinos who were appointed to the notarial and law positions,
received such appointment only temporarily. The same is true also
regarding physicians. This condition was one factor in the development
of the last revolution against Spain. The Dominican report of 1887 also
says: &ldquo;Both secondary and higher instruction cost nothing to the
treasury in the Philippines. The colleges of Santo Tom&aacute;s and of
San Juan de Letran are supported from the funds of the corporation to
which they belong. The expenses of the university are defrayed with
regard to the studies of medicine and pharmacy by the revenues of the
college of San Jos&eacute;, devoted to that purpose by several royal
orders, the balance in the treasury of the college last year
[<i>i.e.</i>, 1886], after the deduction of all expenses, having been
only $173.94. The other expenses of the university are defrayed by the
Order of St. Dominic, which has assigned for this purpose, a large
personnel serving without charge. Furthermore, the building of the
college of Santo Tom&aacute;s, its library, museum, cabinet, and other
equipment, are devoted to educational purposes, with all the personnel
and supplies necessary for its preservation and improvement. The only
university receipts are those from the payment of matriculations,
examination fees, and diplomas. The average receipts, deducting
therefrom what corresponds, according to law, to professors, the
secretary, etc., amount to $14,000, and the expenditures to $30,000.
The latter figure does not include the cost of repairs, the support of
the building, cabinet, museum, and library, and other dependencies of
Santo Tom&aacute;s, religions feasts, and other expenses which are not
defrayed from the treasury of the university.&rdquo; See <i>ut

<p class="par first">[Diaz (<i lang="es">Conquistas de las
Filipinas</i>), speaks as follows of the short existence of the royal
college of San Felipe.]</p>
<p class="par">Governor Don Sebasti&aacute;n Hurtado de Corcuera, a
magnanimous gentleman, determined to found a royal college under the
title of San Felipe in honor of Felipe IV, in whose reign he assigned
four thousand pesos from the royal treasury for twenty becas, until
other means should be carried out for their support. He joined it to
the college of San Jos&eacute; of Manila, which is under the charge and
direction of the Jesuit religious of the Society. The latter college is
the older in foundation of the two in the city, leaving out of account
the seminary of San Ju&aacute;n de Letr&aacute;n, which together with
the college of Santo Tom&aacute;s is in charge of the religious of St.
Dominic. Both colleges are gardens of letters and virtue which adorn
the ecclesiastical estate, both secular and regular. Very many very
eminent persons, both seculars and regulars,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2670src" href="#xd21e2670" name="xd21e2670src">1</a> have
graduated from those colleges, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb171"

bishops, and Doctor Endaya y Haro, who after being dean of the
cathedral of Plasencia, Espa&ntilde;a, is at present archdeacon of
Alarc&oacute;n, a dignity of the cathedral of Cuenca, one of the
greatest dignities of Espa&ntilde;a, besides many others who require a
separate history. The twenty becas were given to the finest youths in
Manila on the day of St. Sebastian of that year, 1641, amid great
applause and gatherings, and they were given the title of royal
collegiates.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2689src" href="#xd21e2689"
name="xd21e2689src">2</a> The religious of the Society of Jesus took
charge of the management and instruction of that college with that care
and zeal which they usually display. But the permanence of that college
endured only during the government of Don Sebasti&aacute;n Hurtado de
Corcuera, namely, until the year 1644, when that royal college of San
Felipe was destroyed, and the fathers of the Society had to pay the
12,000 pesos which they had spent during those three years on the
support [of those pupils], the many good representations made by the
said religious&mdash;who charged that the royal decree which was
couched in very strict terms for that purpose, was obtained by false
representation<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2692src" href="#xd21e2692"
name="xd21e2692src">3</a>&mdash;being of no avail. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb172" href="#pb172" name="pb172">172</a>]</span>The
new governor Don Diego Faxardo executed that decree with the integrity
which these islands experienced in him. The royal treasury owed 8,000
pesos to the fathers of the Society, but they were not allowed to
receive them on account. Thus they had to lose those loans. Our
province aided them with 8,000 pesos which it had in deposit from some
annuities [<i lang="es">censos</i>] which their owners had received,
and 4,000 were lent them by Captain Manuel Estacio Venegas, a very
important person of these islands.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2706src"
href="#xd21e2706" name="xd21e2706src">4</a>... This was the beginning,
permanence, and end of that unfortunate college of San Felipe, whose
idea we have seen to have been executed and established by the royal
will of King Don Felipe V, in the foundation of the royal college of
San Felipe newly established in houses that formerly belonged to
Captain Gabriel Diaz del Castillo, and afterward confiscated for the
properties of Licentiate Manuel Su&aacute;rez de Olivera, who was also
an example of the advantage of wealth in this world, for his wealth all
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb173" href="#pb173" name=

it (and he had much) enough to apply to a mass for his soul. The royal
college of San Felipe has twelve violet colored becas over red mantles,
with the arms of Castilla and Leon in silver on the breast. They are
obliged to be present at the cathedral in their seminary body during
the divine offices, and serve as acolytes and other lesser duties of
the altar. Their first rector and the only one as yet, is Licentiate
Don Gabriel de Isturis, presbyter, advocate of the royal Audiencia. He
was alcalde-in-ordinary of the city of Manila while in the world, and

<p class="par first">[The following is condensed from annotations of
Rev. Pablo Pastells, S.J., in his edition of Colin&rsquo;s <i lang=
"es">Labor evang&eacute;lica</i>.]</p>
<p class="par">The college of San Felipe de Austria was founded by
Sebasti&aacute;n Hurtado de Corcuera, at the instance of the
ayuntamiento of Manila, and was annexed to the college of San
Jos&eacute; of Manila. The cabildo proposed to Corcuera, December 15,
1640, that eighteen royal fellowships and two college servants be
assigned in the college of San Jos&eacute; or Santo Tom&aacute;s, which
were to be given as a reward to those possessing greatest merit and
highest rank, because of the great poverty of many of the children and
descendants of those who had performed the greatest services for the
crown in Filipinas. In view of the fact that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb174" href="#pb174" name=
"pb174">174</a>]</span>there are two universities in Manila, Corcuera
is asked to confer in regard to the matter, &ldquo;so that in the
college which his Lordship shall assign, of the two above-mentioned,
there be eighteen fellowships, and two college servants&mdash;twenty in
all&mdash;and that to them be appointed those who shall deserve it most
and those of the highest rank, with the beca and gown that shall be
regarded as fitting, in order that they may be recognized as such, and
which shall be different from those worn by the other students. For
their support and clothing, a sum of three thousand pesos shall be set
aside annually.&rdquo; The graduates were to succeed, after passing
competitive examination, to the canonries of the Manila cathedral.</p>
<p class="par">Corcuera signed the decree founding the college,
December 23, 1640, and the direction of the same was given to the
Jesuits. By that decree, twenty fellowships were created, and six
Pampango college servants provided for. The turn of four thousand pesos
was assigned for their support, 3,000 being for the twenty fellowships,
and the remaining 1,000 for one master and the six servants. Provision
was made for this sum from four hundred of the general licenses which
were issued to the Sangleys, granting them permission to remain in
Manila.</p>
<p class="par">January 19, 1641, Corcuera issued the rules and
regulations for the new college&mdash;thirty-three in
number&mdash;after having conferred with Doctor Diego de Rivera
Maldonado; auditor of the royal Audiencia. These rules and regulations
provide as follows:<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2738src" href=
"#xd21e2738" name="xd21e2738src">6</a></p>
<p class="par">1. There shall be twenty collegiates, &ldquo;who must
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb175" href="#pb175" name=

deserving persons who have served his Majesty in these islands. The
sons of the auditors of this royal Audiencia, living or dead, and those
of the royal official judges, and those of all the war officers, great
and small, shall always have the preference; and in default of them,
any others of these islands, who possess the necessary qualifications.
Said collegiates shall be in the charge and under the care of the
father rector, present or future, of the said college; and no one shall
enter the college or be received therein unless he shall have presented
a government provision therefor to the said father rector.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">2. The college servants shall be of influential Pampango
families, and they shall be taught &ldquo;to read and write, and the
Spanish language,&rdquo; and shall be given clerkships if they show
aptitude therefor.</p>
<p class="par">3. The collegiates must be of pure race and have no
mixture of Moorish or Jewish blood, to the fourth degree, and shall
have no negro or Bengal blood, or that of any similar nation, in their
veins, or a fourth part of Filipino blood.</p>
<p class="par">4. The royal arms shall be placed above the principal
door of the college, and surrounding those arms the Latin words:
<i lang="la">Collegium regale divi Philippi</i> [Royal college of San
Felipe].</p>
<p class="par">5. The outside clothing worn by the collegiates shall be
a gown of blue and black silk, and a beca of purple velvet, and on the
left side an escutcheon with the arms of Castilla and Leon with the
royal crown above, and below, the fleece whence protrudes the cross of
Alcantara, edged at the points with gold. The sleeves and bonnet shall
be black. In the house <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb176" href=
"#pb176" name="pb176">176</a>]</span>they shall wear a garment of the
same silk and color in place of the gown. The college servants shall
wear a semi-cassock of the same silk material, with hat and girdle,
with the royal arms on the left side of the breast.</p>
<p class="par">6. All that is necessary for the support and clothing of
the collegiates shall be given them, being paid for from the 150 pesos
assigned for each one. They shall each be provided with one silken
gown, one beca of purple velvet, one silken garment, one bonnet, four
pairs of sleeves of black taffeta, six shirts and six pairs of linen
breeches, twelve pairs of shoes, four pairs of cotton socks, two pairs
of breeches and two doublets, and one dozen linen collars.</p>
<p class="par">7. Twelve of the collegiates shall be art students
[<i lang="es">pasantes de facultad</i>], and the other eight, grammar,
but the governors may vary the number of those in each branch at their
pleasure.</p>
<p class="par">8. The course shall take eight years, and shall comprise
three in arts and four in theology; and no collegiate may be more than
seven years in the said college and one year as a lodger, unless
elected as a conciliar the last year, after which he shall then be a
lodger. Those studying grammar shall remain nine years.</p>
<p class="par">9. When there is a sufficient number who wish to be
given a fellowship, a competitive examination shall be held.</p>
<p class="par">10. Until there are those who can compete for the
fellowships, they shall be appointed after taking an examination given
by the three fathers named by the rector.</p>
<p class="par">11. All collegiates must take an oath of mutual defense
in and out of the college, and must defend the Immaculate Conception of
the Virgin. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb177" href="#pb177" name=

<p class="par">12. The collegiates must be given sufficient food, and
on certain feast days, viz., of Sts. Philip and James, St. Sebastian,
and the day of the Immaculate Conception, something extra.</p>
<p class="par">13. The hours shall correspond to those of the
university of San Jos&eacute;.</p>
<p class="par">14. The collegiates shall confess and take communion at
least five times per year, viz., on the three feasts of Christmas,
Easter, and Pentecost, and the days of Sts. Sebastian and Philip, under
penalty of a fortnight&rsquo;s seclusion every time they fail to
observe it, and loss of their college portion for that time.</p>
<p class="par">15. The students of San Jos&eacute; shall be preferred
to all others in competition for fellowships.</p>
<p class="par">16. These shall be defended every Saturday when no legal
obstacle presents itself.</p>
<p class="par">17. All the collegiates shall be obliged to attend
vespers and mass in the royal chapel on St. Sebastian&rsquo;s day, and
on the feast of the most holy sacrament held at the same place, and
they shall have to take part in the procession of the latter day as
well as on the day of Sts. Philip and James (May 2).</p>
<p class="par">18. Gambling with cards, dice, or in other manner is
forbidden, the penalties being for the first time, seclusion for a
fortnight and deprivation of the college portion for that time; for the
second, that penalty doubled, and for the third, dismissal from the
college.</p>
<p class="par">19. The college shall be locked after the evening
prayer, after time has been allowed for the collegiates to arrive from
the farthest part of the city. The third time that any collegiate is
late, he shall be dismissed from the college. No collegiate may go into
the city without his gown and beca.</p>
<p class="par">20. The library shall be open two hours in the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb178" href="#pb178" name=
"pb178">178</a>]</span>morning and two in the afternoon, but no book
shall be taken from it, &ldquo;under penalty that the collegiate so
doing, shall not enter the library for six months, and shall pay the
college for the book, unless he return it. The librarian or attendant
shall be the senior collegiate, and he shall be present in the said
library one hour in the morning and one in the afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">21. Corcuera prescribes that he be advised of any case
for expulsion in order that he may give permission for such expulsion.
Expulsion shall take place if it is proved that any collegiate has
obtained the beca for sinister reasons, or is not of the proper purity
of blood.</p>
<p class="par">22. The collegiates shall live a good moral life under
penalty of expulsion.</p>
<p class="par">23. Collegiates shall be preferred in all appointments
to the beneficed curacies and in the church dignities.</p>
<p class="par">24. Every day the collegiates shall recite a prayer for
the king, besides a responsary for the deceased sovereigns. They shall
assemble (as is the custom at San Jos&eacute;) twice in the chapel,
once on rising in the morning, and the second time at night, at which
times the said prayers shall be repeated.</p>
<p class="par">25. The auditor Diego de Rivera shall be the protector
of the college, and in his absence, the one who shall be appointed by
the government. The governor shall inspect the college annually without
the intervention of any ecclesiastic, but he may delegate it to the
father provincial of the Society.</p>
<p class="par">26. On the day of the patron saint of the college, the
collegiates shall assemble and three of the most capable shall be
chosen as assistants to the rector in matters of importance.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb179" href="#pb179" name=

<p class="par">27 and 28. The college shall contain archives for the
conservation of important papers, and records.</p>
<p class="par">29. The rector shall have especial care of the money
assigned for the support of the collegiates.</p>
<p class="par">30. One of the art or theological collegiates shall be
elected annually as conciliar, when the number is sufficient to warrant
it.</p>
<p class="par">31. If the expenses of the degree of doctor or
licentiate in any course reach 400 pesos, counting the fees, theaters,
gloves, collations, and other things, the royal collegiates shall pay
only half the fees to the doctors and teachers.</p>
<p class="par">32. The senior collegiate in any course shall be
graduated before the other students in that course.</p>
<p class="par">33. The college is entrusted to the Jesuits as Corcuera
has full confidence in them.</p>
<p class="par">The Dominicans asked that the twenty fellowships founded
by Corcuera be adjudged to their college, without any gratification or
income. Their request was made by the rector of that college, Fray
Domingo Goncales, and the other religious of the same, and they offered
to take the twenty students free of all charge to the king, as an
appreciation of the latter&rsquo;s many favors to their college.
Corcuera answered the request by a decree, November 23, 1640, in which
he suggested that the Dominicans might use the 3,000 pesos which they
offered for the support of the fellowships, for bringing over
missionaries of their order from Spain, thus relieving the king of that
expense. But it is not in accord with the greatness of the king to
listen to such a proposal. On August 8, 1641, Corcuera wrote to Felipe
IV, stating the reason which induced him to found the college. He cites
therein the request made him by the Manila cabildo, encloses the
Dominican&rsquo;s petition, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb180" href=
"#pb180" name="pb180">180</a>]</span>and gives his reasons for refusing
it. He also asks that the college be exempted from the payment of the
half-annats, as it is a royal institution.</p>
<p class="par">When Diego Fajardo took possession of the government,
August 11, 1644, he ordered the assignments for the fellowships,
amounting now to 12,000 pesos, belonging to the college of San Felipe,
now received by the college of San Jos&eacute;, to be returned, in
accordance with a royal decree dated June 16, 1643, ordering the former
college discontinued. The Jesuits urged against the measure &ldquo;that
his Majesty did not order that the Society should pay the said sum, but
that there be given to the royal treasury what the Society had
received, leaving it to the decision of the royal official judges how
it was to be paid and by whom; that the seminary of San Jos&eacute; was
a distinct college, and had made no use of what had been spent in the
support of the royal college; that it was only interested because it
had given them a house in which to live: consequently it was not right
that it should pay from the income which its founder had instituted,
what they had not eaten and drunk. As regards the embargo of property,
we alleged immunity, for it was proved that the incomes of the college
of San Jos&eacute; were ecclesiastical.&rdquo; The sentence was given
in favor of the Society by the royal officials, but the governor would
not listen. The Society were ordered to pay the 12,000 within three
days. The governor refused to discount 8,000 pesos owed the Society by
the treasury, and to take 4,000 pesos in cash, and hence, it became
necessary for the Society to seek a loan. The king on fuller
information, ordered the Society to be reimbursed to the amount of the
12,000 pesos, if it had been collected <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

Concepci&oacute;n says (vi, pp. 190, 191) that a house was bought for
the new college next to the college of San Jos&eacute;; and January 20,
1641, the first becas were given. Some of the Jesuits did not approve
the new college, and sighted the fatal results from afar, &ldquo;from
taking so great a sum from the royal treasury, without sufficient

&ldquo;The Society alleged that the decree was obtained on false
representation and contained falsehoods in its narration; that its
execution should be suspended, until truer reports were given to the
sovereign; that, even laying aside this vice, the Society, against whom
the execution was to be made, was not a party; that the royal decree
did not order it, nor did law declare it, because neither the Society
nor the college of San Joseph was interested in such sum, which at best
ought to be collected from the collegiates, for whose use it had been
spent, or from the governor, at whose order the money had been paid
out; and that the embargo was an excess on laymen, since it was in
ecclesiastical incomes.&rdquo; On this account the royal officials
decreed in favor of the Society. See Concepci&oacute;n&rsquo;s <i lang=

&ldquo;The Society continued its demands at court, and gained their
plea, and the governor was ordered, in case that sum had been
collected, to restore it to the Society. If that sum had not been paid,
no further effort was to be made to collect it. Seemingly this order
had no effect, for the king gave them as recompense an encomienda, in
which the Society were to make good their losses.&rdquo;

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">This decree ordained that the archbishop should
make all the efforts that he possibly could to maintain at their
studies such Indians of the islands as were inclined to that pursuit,
and in due time should promote them to holy orders, when he found them
properly instructed; and that for this purpose some boys should enter
the colleges that the Dominicans and Jesuits maintain, until a seminary
be founded. The archbishop stated the little inclination that the
Indians have for theological and moral studies, and that there was the
additional difficulty of their evil customs, their vices, and their
preconceived ideas&mdash;which made it necessary to treat them as
children, even when they were fifty or sixty years old. He considered
even the sons of Spaniards, born in the islands, unsuitable for
priests, since they were reared by Indian or slave women, because of
their defective training and education in youth. Finally, on account of
the sloth produced by the climate, and of effeminacy and levity of
disposition, it was evident that if they were ordained priests and made
ministers to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb183" href="#pb183"

qualified therefor, through the necessity there was for them, they did
not again open a book, and with their vicious habits set a very bad
example to their parishioners. That which should be done was to send

the Christian doctrine in that language, so that they may become more

royal Council of the Indias, the great advisability of observing this
in the future strictly and inviolably, as it is inferred to be the most
efficient means for banishing idolatries, to which the Indians are for
the greater part addicted at present, as they were in the beginning of
their conversion, from this means also it follows that the vexations
which are practiced on them will cease in whole or in great part, and
the Indians will be able to make their complaints directly to the
superiors without making use of interpreters, who being bribed change
the translation, I have resolved to order and command, as I do by this
present, my viceroys, presidents, governors, corregidors, and
alcaldes-mayor, who hold office at present or shall hold office in the
future, of all the provinces of Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, Guatemala,

cathedrals of those countries, each one, so far as it concerns him, to
watch carefully and strictly over the observance of the laws above
cited. They shall cause them to be carried out strictly, without any

<p class="par"><i>Decree of King Felipe V to the royal Audiencia of
Manila, in regard to a seminary which the king ordered to be founded in
that city.</i></p>
<p class="par">President and Auditors of my royal Audiencia of the city
of Manila, in the Filipinas Islands: By a despatch of April 28, of the
former year, 1702, I ordered the master-of-camp, Don Domingo de
Zabalburu, then governor and captain-general of those islands, to order
the foundation in that city of a seminary with the number of eight
seminarists; the cost of its building and support to be met from the
assets proceeding from the vacant bishoprics of those islands. There
was also to be applied for this purpose what might be necessary from
the tithes. In case what was assigned for these expenses was
insufficient, the sum lacking was to be supplied by my royal treasury.
I advised him of the equity with which he was to work in this matter,
which should be with the advice of the archbishop of that metropolitan
church (to whom the same charge was made). He was to inform me of the
advance made in the foundation of the above-mentioned seminary.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb188" href="#pb188" name=
"pb188">188</a>]</span>But not learning from him what he has spent, the
apostolic nuncio who resides in this capital has informed me of the
news that his Holiness possesses (by report of Cardinal
Tournon,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2916src" href="#xd21e2916" name=
"xd21e2916src">1</a> after conferring with the archbishop, Don Diego
Camacho y Avila, at present bishop of Guadalajara) of the progress of
the seminary founded by the above-mentioned archbishop in that city,
and that Abbot Sidoti<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2922src" href=
"#xd21e2922" name="xd21e2922src">2</a> (one of the missionaries who
went to China) in the time when he was detained there [<i>i.e.</i>, in
Manila] in order to pass to Japon, settled the differences existing
between the governor and archbishop, and that they had delayed this
foundation. That foundation was then much advanced by the means which
he applied therefor, and the copious alms which were contributed by the
faithful, especially by the inhabitants of the islands near that city,
who had given to the abovesaid abbot for that purpose, all the wood
which was necessary, and had paid seven hundred men for its cutting and
transportation. With that wood a large edifice was built near the
church and archiepiscopal palace. At the rate at which the work was
advancing, many were encouraged to enter the seminary in which were
more than eighty seminarists. Some of them were those appointed by the
above-mentioned my governor, as my vice-patron. Others were supported
by the assistance of their parents, and others by the piety of the
faithful. For that reason the archbishop needed teachers to devote
themselves to the education of that family, and his Holiness praising
the pious mind with which at my expense (as protector of religion) its
promotion has <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb189" href="#pb189" name=
"pb189">189</a>]</span>been begun in those islands, and desiring that
the gospel law be more defended in them every day, he had condescended,
at the instances of archbishop and governor, and had given permission
to Cardinal Tournon so that he might send to the assistance of the
above-mentioned seminary one of his apostolic men, of tried virtue and
ability, so that, it being my royal pleasure, he might be employed in
instructing those recently converted, and in educating all who come
from the neighboring kingdom in the gospel doctrine. Since that intent
is so pleasing to God (since its purpose is to extend His true worship)
his Blessedness trusted that it would be acceptable to me, and that I
would give order for the furnishing of the fitting means, in order that
so worthy an undertaking might be perfected and maintained, since by
means of it the rearing in my domains of apostolic men would be
obtained with the education of the greatest consideration, and the
veneration due my royal person. Without prejudice to the seminary, and
to the advantage of that city, very worthy subjects [it was
represented] would graduate therefrom for the ministry of preachers,
and for the office of parish priests, and those islands would be
provided with very worthy subjects who would perform the duties of the
apostolic institute, without there resulting to my royal treasury the
vast expense of their transportation to so remote provinces, and of
their maintenance therein. That representation having been examined in
my Council of the Indias, and they consulting with me in regard to it,
I have resolved to give notice of these things (as is done by the
despatch of this day) to my governor and captain-general of those
islands, telling him our great astonishment that that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb190" href="#pb190" name="pb190">190</a>]</span>news
has arrived by the medium through which it has been received, without
his predecessor (in fulfilment of his first and due obligation) having
informed me of so unexpected an innovation as that of having admitted
into those islands foreign persons, to whose active effort the Roman
court has been able to attribute the progress of the conversions and
the propagation of our holy faith, when the principal consideration of
my Catholic zeal consists in the despatch and support (at so great
expense to my royal treasury) of the great number of learned
missionaries of the orders which are established in those islands; that
what the above-mentioned governor permitted is so contrary to the
obligation and fulfilment of that purpose, as is manifest in the
displeasure with which I view the fact that he allowed (with so great
offense to my service) the excessive number of seminarists who have
been received in the new college, many of them not being my vassals,
but foreigners, who are admitted without my express license; that I
should hear this great innovation and those harmful acts by other
medium than that of my vassals and ministers; and that the conditions
established in the foundation which I resolved with so great
anticipation should be made, were altered. I order and command that, as
soon as the despatch which is sent is received, without the least
delay, all the foreign seminarists in the said seminary shall be
immediately removed therefrom; and of those who shall be my vassals,
those in excess of the number of the eight whom I have preferred, for
whose support the calculation has been made, by settling the suitable
compensation with the teachers. Those who desire to be admitted as
boarders shall not exceed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb191" href=
"#pb191" name="pb191">191</a>]</span>sixteen in number, because of the
inconveniences that would result from giving a greater extension to
their entrance into the territory where there are so few Spanish
inhabitants, in which it is necessary for the natives to apply
themselves to the cultivation of the fields and the industries of the
community without anyone being able to enter without your license, as
my vice-patron. Especial care shall be taken for the encouragement and
aid by all possible means for the progress and completion of the
seminary, which I have founded, so that it may exist in the form and
according to the laws established for that purpose, without violating
those laws in any manner. The persons who aided in the building of the
new seminary in good faith with edifices, incomes, and other things,
which they liberally applied and gave for it, shall be petitioned to
condescend to apply it all for the seminary which I have ordered to be
founded. That seminary is to be maintained in the form abovesaid. In
case that such persons do not agree thereto, they shall be paid the
just price of all that which shall be esteemed useful and advantageous
to the above-mentioned seminary. That which shall be considered as
useless for this purpose, shall be restored to its own owners, in the
manner which may be suitable, excepting the edifices which might not be
necessary and which must be destroyed. Not less is the innovation and
wonder that has been caused that, on your part, I have not been
informed of what was done in the above-mentioned seminary, contrary to
what I have determined and established for its foundation, incurring
also with your undue tolerance and forgetfulness of the fulfilment of
your obligation and ministry the same guilt as the governor,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb192" href="#pb192" name=
"pb192">192</a>]</span>and my displeasure. I have desired to inform you
of it and to order you (as I do) that in case the above-mentioned, my
governor and captain-general, does not fulfil the above expressed, my
resolution, with the exactness and in the form which has been ordered
him, you shall execute it without permitting the least delay, because
of its great importance to my service. You shall inform me of all that
may conduce to the success of this matter, in order that I may be
thoroughly advised of it. Given in Madrid, March 3, 1710.</p>

<p class="par">12. Another matter even more delicate, and which
irritated even more the just annoyance of our monarch Phelipe Fifth,
was that in which Se&ntilde;or Tournon took part with even greater
ardor, and the results of which fell heavily upon the governor and the
archbishop. April twenty-eight, one thousand seven hundred and two, a
royal decree was sent to this government, in which was mentioned the
receipt of a letter from Don Juan Fausto Cruzat y Gongora, dated June
thirteen, seven hundred, in observance of a royal despatch of
ninety-seven, which ordered him to report as to whether there was a
college seminary in the metropolitan church of Manila, and in case
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb195" href="#pb195" name=
"pb195">195</a>]</span>there was none, what its foundation and
maintenance would cost. In the above-mentioned letter, Don Fausto
reported that such a foundation was unnecessary. However, his Majesty,
with a spirit of liberality and zeal, resolved upon the foundation with
the number of eight seminarists for the time being. Its foundation and
maintenance were to be paid from the ecclesiastical incomes. The decree
ordered that, after conferring with the archbishop, the account of its
cost should be made and the necessary means should be applied for that
purpose from what was yielded by the vacant bishoprics. The amount that
could be realized from the tithes was also to be ascertained, and [it
was to be stated] whether they met the necessary expenses. For it was
his royal intention that they should be preferred rather than that it
should be at the cost of his royal treasury and estate. The king relied
on the governor&rsquo;s carefulness and accurate direction that he
would treat discreetly and economically concerning such expenses, which
must be made with all the advisable benefit and saving. Whatever he
did, and what result it had, was to be reported promptly. Another royal
despatch was sent to the archbishop. In it his Majesty orders and
resolves that, inasmuch as the sacred canons and pontifical briefs
provide for a seminary for young men in all the cathedral churches, in
order that they may become proficient in the sciences, and apply
themselves to and assist in divine worship, therefore in fulfilment of
them, his Majesty having been informed that there was no such seminary
in Manila, he desired one to be founded from his royal treasury in the
metropolitan church. For the time being it was to have eight
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb196" href="#pb196" name=
"pb196">196</a>]</span>seminarists, and the decree goes on to repeat
the orders communicated to the king&rsquo;s governor for that purpose.
These despatches gave advice of the preceding reports of the government
to the effect that no such seminary was necessary, as well as of that
of the archbishop who was of the opinion that the cost should be met
from the pensioned curacies, in proportion to their ecclesiastical
allowances. His Majesty determined that the foundation and maintenance
should be met not from the pensions of the curas, as such was not
stipulated by the Council of Trent, but from the ecclesiastical incomes
which the crown enjoys, by virtue of pontifical bulls, the balance
being supplied from his royal treasury. Inasmuch as his immunity might
be prejudiced, his Majesty advised his governor of the communication
with the reverend archbishop, thus avoiding disturbances and
litigations in regard to the net amounts [<i lang="es">liquidus</i>]
with the assignment in the ecclesiastical effects, such resolution
being merely informative and not executive. The execution is charged
only upon the governor, as is immediately inferred from what the royal
despatch says: &ldquo;You shall give me information of what you shall
do, and its result.&rdquo; The decree addressed to the archbishop does
not say this, from which it is evidently deduced that his
Majesty&rsquo;s wish is that the communication to the archbishop is
merely economic, in regard to the savings of the royal treasury, and
authoritative, in the application of such ecclesiastical properties, so
far as may be necessary.</p>
<p class="par">13. The amount of the tithes and vacancies was, in fact,
ascertained in the execution of the decree with the aid of his
Excellency, Don Diego Camacho. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb197"
href="#pb197" name="pb197">197</a>]</span>It was found that the tithes,
as a general rule, are not collected in these islands; and that those
which are received regularly from some estates, do not exceed the sum
of four hundred pesos per annum, and they are received by the cathedral
church through a concession. The vacancies not proceeding from the
products of curacies, could only be in the allowances with which his
Majesty aids the bishops for their suitable support from the effects of
his royal patrimony, exempt from the obligations by which the tithes,
as ecclesiastical incomes, are accompanied, because of vacancies, and
are to be converted into benefit for the new prelate, church, and pious
uses. However, investigation was made of the vacancies of such
stipends, and it was found uniformly in the certifications of the royal
officials that they were converted as though they were tithes; and that
they were applied to the holy church for its building fund, and for the
aid of the archbishops and bishops who had come to these islands, as an
aid in the pontifical expenses, and to furnish their household
furniture and other things in a fitting manner. Only one vacancy of one
of the bishoprics was then found without pay warrant, but its warrant
was expected immediately. And although this and the subsequent
vacancies were obtained in three payments, those payments were already
applied to the expenses of the professors, both those which came from
the royal treasury and those of the church fund, and maintenance of
such college seminary, which necessarily became perpetual without
redintegration being made in whole or in part.</p>
<p class="par">14. The conditions of the first foundation were changed,
very much against the intention of his Majesty, by the arrival at
Manila of the patriarch, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb198" href=
"#pb198" name="pb198">198</a>]</span>Don Carlos Thomas Maillard de
Tournon. The right reverend Camacho came to terms with that gentleman,
who took a hand in that college, and altered its foundation, by
increasing it with foreign seminarists without the intervention of the
vice-patron. Several alms which had been collected were applied to the
maintenance of seventy-two collegiates who were to be of all
nationalities. A new and showy building was provided for on a site
opposite the archiepiscopal palace. For this enterprise was also
applied a portion of certain alms which had been collected by Abbot
Sidoti, amounting to twelve thousand pesos, which were given into the
care of the financial board of the Misericordia, in order that they
might yield a suitable return, and their products in the investments
realized were applied by the said abbot to various pious purposes, one
of them being that of the seventy-two seminarists. His consideration
for the apostolic visitor and patriarch, and for the powers promulgated
for all by the Apostolic See, reprehensibly restrained Se&ntilde;or
Zabalbur&ugrave; in the performance of his duties.</p>
<p class="par">15. This was aided by seeing the archbishop so greatly
in harmony with the patriarch. This fact also intimidated the royal
Audiencia, so that they passed the matter by with most criminal
carelessness in so peculiar and irregular proceedings, and the rights
so suitably belonging to the monarch were violated very shamefully.
With such condescension, the archbishop passed to the remarkable
audacity of influencing Se&ntilde;or Tournon, to report by common
consent all that had been done to his Holiness, so that the latter
might approve the excesses independently of the royal patronage in the
increase of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb199" href="#pb199" name=
"pb199">199</a>]</span>teachers because of the lack which he considered
in the education of the collegiates, and apply for their salaries the
various alms which he had gathered, and for the maintenance of
seventy-two seminarists who were to be of all nationalities, and for
the new building. The government and the royal Audiencia were so
remiss, that such information came to his Majesty&rsquo;s ears through
the nuncio of his Holiness who resided in his court, to whom the
patriarch and the archbishop had communicated it. His Majesty wondered
that his governor Zabalbur&ugrave; had not informed him of so weighty
an innovation in the progress of the seminary, and that he had not
given information regarding the observance of the royal decrees, in
which his [<i>i.e.</i>, the king&rsquo;s] watchful zeal had proposed
the foundation of the seminary college.</p>
<p class="par">16. So angry was the court against the right reverend
prelate Se&ntilde;or Camacho, where his connivance with the patriarch
was so displeasing, that he was removed from this metropolitan see to
the bishopric of Guadalaxara in Nueva Espa&ntilde;a. He went thither in
the year one thousand seven hundred and six, to take possession of his
government. He was a zealous and charitable archbishop. From the due
salary of his predecessor, Se&ntilde;or Poblete, from various alms
given by the king, and from those given by pious private persons, his
zealous diligence got together more than forty thousand pesos. He spent
them in this holy church of Manila in its decoration and ornament. He
gilded the reredos, beautified the choir, enriched the sacristy with
chalices and ornaments, and as well built the excellent steeple from
its foundations, and other things. More than twenty thousand pesos were
pledged in these expenses <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb200" href=
"#pb200" name="pb200">200</a>]</span>and in various alms. He was a
vigilant shepherd, and if the violent controversies above mentioned
which he had with the regulars occurred, he can very easily be excused
in what did not exceed the authority and dignity of his office. He
promoted the missions of Paynaan and San Isidro, where he went in
person to induce the Aetas or Negritos to become converted. [Other
facts concerning the life of Camacho follow.]<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3000src" href="#xd21e3000" name="xd21e3000src">3</a></p>
<p class="par">18. No arbitrary measures were taken. His Majesty gave
place to the anger that had been conceived, and the representation of
the nuncio was examined in the royal and supreme Council. His royal
Majesty having been informed concerning the matter, resolved in his
royal despatch that the admission of foreign persons into these islands
for such a purpose was an unexpected innovation, and to whose active
diligence the Roman court might attribute the progress of the
conversions. In that his royal zeal might be seen to be corrected,
since his principal consideration in his Catholic zeal, was to send and
to maintain at so great cost, a great number of ministers chosen from
the orders which had been established in these islands. What had been
permitted by Governor Zabalbur&ugrave; was to the great violation of
the obligation and fulfilment of such a purpose, and the displeasure
with which his Majesty viewed the fact that so offensive an act had
been allowed against his royal service in the excessive number of
seminarists was harshly manifested; as was the fact that foreigners who
were not his vassals had been received in said college, and admitted
without his royal and express <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb201"
href="#pb201" name="pb201">201</a>]</span>license; and the fact that he
had heard that great innovation and those prejudicial proceedings
through other mediums than those of his ministers and vassals: thus
having altered the conditions which he had resolved should be made so
long before.</p>
<p class="par">19. His Majesty orders and commands his [<i>i.e.</i>,
Zabalbur&uacute;&rsquo;s] successor in the government, Count de
Lizaraga, as soon as he received this despatch, and without the
slightest delay, to immediately remove all the foreign seminarists from
such seminary; while of those who should be his own vassals, all those
in excess of the number of eight, whom he had preferred, and for whose
support the calculation had been made, by deciding with the necessary
teachers upon the suitable allowance, if they desired to enter as
boarders, they could not exceed the number of sixteen. [This was done]
in order to avoid the troubles that might result if the privilege of
admission were extended farther, in a territory where there were so few
Spanish inhabitants, where it was necessary for the natives to apply
themselves to the cultivation of the soil, and the industries of the
community. It was to be noted that no one could enter without the
permission of the vice-patron, to whose activity he charges the
especial care, and orders him to aid by all means possible the progress
and conclusion of the seminary, which he had founded, in order that it
might subsist in the manner and according to the laws established,
without transgressing those laws in any manner. He was to arrange with
the persons who with good faith assisted in the said building fund,
with incomes, edifices, and other things, which they applied liberally,
in order that they might condescend to apply the whole to what his
Majesty had <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb202" href="#pb202" name=
"pb202">202</a>]</span>ordered to be erected. In case they did not
agree thereto, the just price was to be paid them, of whatever should
be considered useful to the said seminary, while what might be
considered useless was to be returned to its owners, in the best and
most fitting form, except the buildings, which were to be necessarily
destroyed. His Majesty insists that he be informed as quickly as
possible, because of its great importance, of the observance of his
resolution. For the same purpose, he orders the same of his royal
Audiencia, by a despatch of the same day, and orders that decree to be
read annually at the opening [of the seminary] in January (as is done),
in order that it might be exactly observed and in order to avoid such
intrusions, to the great prejudice of the supreme rights and
privileges.</p>
<p class="par">20. In fulfilment of that royal decree, the
investigation of the alms gathered by Abbot Sidoti was made. The
application of those alms, by virtue of the conditions of the pious
foundations, could not be used for the support of the eight
seminarists, who were appointed at his Majesty&rsquo;s account; nor to
aid the expenses of the royal treasury in the new building of the
college on the site of the houses sequestered from [the property of]
Licentiate Don Manuel Suarez de Olivera. The inhabitants who had
contributed to the building fund and incomes with their alms were asked
that such be allowed to be freely applied to the college ordered to be
erected by his Majesty. In such an innovation, greater expenses were
incurred by the royal treasury on the site opposite to the
archiepiscopal palace and solicited by the governor and archbishop,
because the purchase and expense of timber and its haulage were
effected at a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb203" href="#pb203" name=
"pb203">203</a>]</span>cost of four thousand pesos which were paid on
the account of the royal treasury to General Don Miguel de Eloriaga so
that they might be spent with the intervention of the said abbot. That
is evident in the records of the account of said general presented and
sworn to, in regard to such expenses, with an attestation from the said
Sidoti that it was true. Thus that was a superfluous expense on the
royal treasury. For although a portion of the timber bought for that
money was used for the addition to the new building on the site next
the sequestered house of Licentiate Suarez, in order to give greater
extension to the college, very little of it was useful, and did not
amount, together with that which was sold, to two thousand pesos in
value. The remainder was lost with the purchased and abandoned site
which was used for nothing. That could have been built with four
thousand pesos if the building attempted opposite the archiepiscopal
palace had been left out of the question. In that the cost to the royal
treasury was about six thousand pesos, the annual maintenance
aggregating one thousand two hundred pesos, without noting the
necessary expenses for physician, apothecary, and other things, plus
two hundred pesos for two professors in philosophy and theology.</p>
<p class="par">21. His Majesty also resolved to order and command his
governor, as soon as he received that despatch, to order and take
measures, as was most advisable and efficacious, to suppress the name
of San Clemente which had been given to the seminary by the abbot, and
to change it into that of San Phelipe, in order that no remembrance
might be left of the sinister reports of which his Holiness had been
informed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb204" href="#pb204" name=
"pb204">204</a>]</span>to the discredit of the royal and earnest zeal
in providing measures for the advance of religion, without giving the
slightest motive for so peculiar and special influences. The fitting
measures for the change of name were really taken, and that fact was
recorded in the books of the accountancy and of the said college. The
archbishop, dean, and cabildo were informed thereof, in order that they
might properly observe it.</p>
<p class="par">[As punishment for his omission, Governor
Zabalbur&uacute; was dismissed, although his term was already ended, as
were also the auditors. The governor was a just man, but his intimacy
with the Jesuits caused him to be distrusted.]</p>
<p class="par">[Chapter xiv contains the following in regard to this
seminary.]</p>
<p class="par">2. During his government [<i>i.e.</i>, of the new
archbishop, Fray Francisco de la Cuesta, of the Order of San Geronimo]
arrived the resolution regarding the seminary college of San Phelipe.
Its erection was entrusted to his Excellency, Se&ntilde;or Cuesta. He
having made the foundation, proceeded to draw up its rules, which being
milder for the seminarists, corrected those of the most illustrious
Camacho. However, most of them were not in accord with the royal
patronage, and its rights. His Excellency incurred the inadvertence of
prescribing in the second of his rules that the escutcheon of the royal
arms should be placed on a prominent spot, while in the interior or in
any other part of the said seminary, were also to be placed the arms of
the archbishop. In doing so, he said that he was in accord with the
second law of the first book and twenty-third t&iacute;tulo of the
<i lang="es">Recopilaci&oacute;n</i> <a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3038src" href="#xd21e3038" name="xd21e3038src">4</a> of these
kingdoms. That would be <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb205" href=
"#pb205" name="pb205">205</a>]</span>allowable if the seminary had been
founded at his cost or at the cost pro rata given by his prebendaries
and others who are mentioned in the Council of Trent. In that he
claimed the right of private patronage, reserving for his Majesty only
the universal patronage. That was a surprising resolution, since the
archbishop himself confessed that the seminary had been founded at the
expense of the royal treasury, while the placing of escutcheons and
arms signifies one&rsquo;s private expenses and special zeal; when his
Majesty, without any controversy, is the sole founder. Therefore its
foundation was purely lay, and in such concept, beyond any question the
universal and private patronage belonged to his Majesty, as it was
founded at the expense of his royal patrimony. Still more harmful were
the fourth and fourteenth rules, in which it is declared that the
nomination and election of the collegiates is at the disposition of the
ordinary, after conferring and obtaining the opinion of the
prebendaries; as is also their expulsion in the case of incorrigibles,
after their rector has informed the ordinary of such: although that
nomination and expulsion belonged very properly (and exclusively) to
his Majesty, as its foundation was not couched in the terms mentioned
by the Council of Trent. To him could only pertain by delivery and by
royal disposition their spiritual government, because of the greater
care in investigating and restraining their morals. The error of his
Excellency was notable in this regard, for although the governor
petitioned <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb206" href="#pb206" name=
"pb206">206</a>]</span>that he be given possession of such seminary, in
the name of his dignity and of his church he declares that the
appointment of rector, administrator, and master is in the first place,
a right of the superior government by virtue of the laws of the royal
patronage, and that he deign to make provision of such posts in persons
justified and qualified as most fitting. For being univocal and in
accord with the doctrine, founded on laws, the naming and disposition
of the collegiates ought also to be private.</p>
<p class="par">3. No measures were taken for the time being to revise
the rules, especially the ones mentioned, conforming them to the royal
patronage. The practice continued of the ordinary giving the despatches
and titles in his provision, until the report of Se&ntilde;or Cuesta to
the government asking that the two professors of philosophy and
theology might be removed, as he considered such chairs unprofitable.
He represented that as a charge on his conscience, asking that
fruitless expenses might not be continued for the royal treasury, thus
opposing the two professors at that time. The matter was given to his
Majesty&rsquo;s fiscal for examination, at that time Se&ntilde;or
Vedoya. His reply was that those professorships ought to be suppressed
because of the reasons alleged; namely, because they were costly to
maintain and of none effect. Thereupon, his Majesty&rsquo;s fiscal
reported the special measure of the royal decree of foundation, which
provides that no one shall enter the said college without the express
license of the vice-patron; that the rules cited were harmful to the
universal and private patronage, and that with the opinion of the
assessor, an express clause should be added to the above-mentioned
fourth rule, by which in order to be admitted <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb207" href="#pb207" name="pb207">207</a>]</span>into
the seminary, the collegiates were to be presented to the vice-patron,
and the permission petitioned which is provided by the royal decree.
The government in accord with that opinion, and with that of the
assessor of the same tenor, informed the archbishop of the measure. The
latter replied that from the time of the receipt of the decree, no
nomination had been made, or any election of collegiate or boarder of
those who had been admitted, as no advice of such circumstance of
license for entrance into said college had been given. In answer to his
reply the fiscal insisted with strong reasons that the royal patronage,
both universal and special, be put into due practice, without allowing
errors in the appropriation of the appointments and approvals in the
entrance of collegiate seminarists. To the ordinary was alone left, by
virtue of his trust from his Majesty, the government and administration
of the collegiates, for the greater security in the investigation of
their qualifications and morals. That was done, and the royal patronage
was left in power.</p>

an end.] <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb208" href="#pb208" name=

<h2 class="main">COLLEGE OF SAN JUAN DE LETRAN</h2>
<div class="argument">
<p class="par first"><i>Of the removal of the college of San Juan de
Letran of Manila</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">On May 8 of this same year, 669, the college of
San Juan de Letran was moved to the site on which it is even yet
located. It had its first beginning in the house of a pious Spaniard,
called Juan Geronimo Guerrero, who had dedicated himself, with
Christian piety, to gathering orphan boys in his house, where he
raised, clothed, and sustained them, and taught them to read and to
write, and much more, to live in the fear of God.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3069src" href="#xd21e3069" name="xd21e3069src">1</a> His piety
was aided by many citizens, who offered him abundant alms. Especially
was the governor, Don Sebastian Hurtado de Corcuera, earnest in aiding
him and helping him by giving him, in the name of the king our
sovereign, some portion of the cost for so holy a work. Among other
things, he gave him an encomienda,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3078src"
href="#xd21e3078" name="xd21e3078src">2</a> in order to sustain the
orphans with its products; and a bit of homestead or arable land, one
hundred brazas long <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb209" href="#pb209"
name="pb209">209</a>]</span>and fifty wide in the alcaycer&iacute;a or
Pari&aacute;n of the Sangleys, in order that they might erect shops
therein without paying any land tax to the city. Both concessions were
afterwards confirmed by the king our sovereign and his royal
Council.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3089src" href="#xd21e3089" name=
"xd21e3089src">3</a></p>
<p class="par">While that good man was employing himself in so holy a
work, a lay-brother religious, a porter of our convent of Manila,
called Fray Diego de Santa Maria, a man of example, virtue, and
perfection, was doing the same also. He gathered orphan and abandoned
boys in the said porter&rsquo;s lodge of the convent, and reared them
in holy and praiseworthy customs. He clothed and sustained them with
alms, which some devout persons gave him, and taught them their first
letters; and, if any were inclined to study grammar, he sent them to
our college of Santo Thomas which is very near the said convent. So
many were the boys who were gathered that a congregation was formed of
them. The said lay-brother religious gave that congregation the name of
San Pedro y San Pablo; for all were clothed in one single manner, and
all kept one form of life, with so great example to all the city that
the admiration of all its citizens was won. And this is not much, since
that work of charity was so agreeable to the eyes of God, who, in order
that one of His servants might see and wonder at it, worked a
prodigious miracle. It happened that a citizen of Manila made a journey
to the city of Lima, where resided the venerable brother, Martin de
Porres, in our convent of El Rosario; and as that servant of God was so
charitable, he was very much pleased to have others so. That citizen of
Manila, by name Francisco Ortiz, told him <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb210" href="#pb210" name="pb210">210</a>]</span>that he knew a
lay-brother religious, a laborer of this place of Manila, a man of most
holy life, who supported with alms twenty-four orphan boys, whom he had
gathered, and was teaching them to read and write. And the most
especial thing which was admired in him was that he never went forth
from the convent in search of those alms, but that our Lord directed
them to him in order that he might carry forward the work of charity,
which he was doing with the said poor boys. The servant of God hearing
that gave him to understand that he desired greatly to know and to
treat with that holy lay-brother, who lived in this city of Manila at a
distance of three thousand leguas from the city of Lima. After three
days, Francisco Ortiz returned to visit the servant of God, whom he
found very cheerful and happy. Smiling the latter gave him to
understand that he had already seen and talked with the said
lay-brother religious of Manila, and had encouraged him to proceed in
so pious a work. What most astonished Francisco Ortiz was to hear the
servant of God talk the Chinese language, which the Sangleys of this
country used, as will be related more in detail in the life of the
servant of God, Martin de Porres.</p>
<p class="par">The pious Juan Geronimo Guerrero, founder of the college
of San Juan de Letran, reached old age, and even a decrepit old age.
Consequently, he became incapable of governing the orphan boys whom he
had gathered. For, lacking and fearing but little the punishment which
youth demands for its better direction, they took it upon themselves to
leave the house whenever they wished, and to run away, contrary to the
pleasure of their patron. Consequently, he was left finally with only
three, who either from <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb211" href=
"#pb211" name="pb211">211</a>]</span>love to their master, or because
of a better natural disposition, did not follow the others. In order
that they might not be lost, he entrusted them to our brother, Fray
Diego de Santa Maria, with whom he had a very close familiarity,
inasmuch as he saw him engaged in his same employment. In order that
the brother might take care of them, and of his own children, he gave
him an allowance and gift in the form of the concessions which the
king, our sovereign, had conceded to him. That cession was accepted by
the governor of the islands, and afterward confirmed by the king our
sovereign. The same favors were conceded to our order so that it might
take charge of the rearing of those orphan and abandoned boys. Juan
Geronimo Guerrero, finding himself free now and exempt from that
occupation, thought only of preparing himself for a good death, and
accordingly begged the father prior of our convent to receive him, and
to take care of him in his infirmary. Not only was that conceded to
him, but, seeing him with the desire to adopt the habit of our order,
gave it to him as lay-brother, and he died as a professed religious of
our order.</p>
<p class="par">This province finding itself pledged with the
prosecution of the rearing of those orphan boys, assigned for them some
low quarters which were near the porter&rsquo;s lodge of our convent of
Santo Domingo. That site already had the form and name of a college
with the title of San Pedro y San Pablo, which it had had from the
beginning. Under this title the college was confirmed by our most
reverend father master general, Fray Thomas Turco. But inasmuch as the
concessions of the king our sovereign were made under the title and
name of the ancient college <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb212" href=
"#pb212" name="pb212">212</a>]</span>of San Juan de Letran, founded by
Juan Geronimo Guerrero, and had been accepted under that title by the
king our sovereign, who received it by various royal decrees under his
royal protection, on that account even yet it has conserved the title
of San Juan de Letran.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3107src" href=
"#xd21e3107" name="xd21e3107src">4</a> However, it also recognizes as
patrons the apostles St. Peter and St. Paul. For the government and
direction of this college, the venerable father, Fray Sebastian de
Oquendo,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3112src" href="#xd21e3112" name=
"xd21e3112src">5</a> prior at that time of the convent of Santo
Domingo, who had charge of the college then, made them some very holy,
but very strict statutes, for they were taken quite exactly from the
rule of our father St. Augustine. But, since they were not obliged to
attain so great perfection, and still being but boys, were not able to
show so much, after some years, the said statutes were revised in a
provincial chapter of this province. Thus did that college maintain
itself for some years in the low quarters of our convent of Santo
Domingo of this city. So greatly did the number of those boys increase
that they sometimes surpassed two hundred, and since there were so
many, and they were boys, one can understand the racket that they must
have made, which could not but be an obstacle to the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb213" href="#pb213" name=
"pb213">213</a>]</span>regularity of a religious convent. Consequently,
the province discussed the question of placing them in a separate
house, which was located opposite the church of the said convent. They
arranged in that house all the necessary rooms for a college, and its
church, and belfry, in order that they might there celebrate the divine
offices; for thus it was conceded expressly in the licenses of the
ordinary, government, and city, which were made for the foundation of
that college.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3120src" href="#xd21e3120"
name="xd21e3120src">6</a></p>
<p class="par">They lived in it but for a short time, for some great
earthquakes happening in the year 1645, that college was entirely
ruined, as well as many other buildings of this city. The city
conceived so great a horror of those earthquakes that many of its
citizens went to live in the suburbs, where they feared less danger of
their ruin. That same reason was taken account of in the rebuilding of
that college, and it was moved outside the city near the
alcaycer&iacute;a or Pari&aacute;n of the Sangleys. With the alms that
some benefactors offered, a college was built out of wood, with its
church also of the same material, all very poor. At that site outside
of the city the college was maintained for about twenty years, with
notable discomfort to the collegiates, both because of the distance of
the university where they had to go to attend to their studies, and
because of the dampness and unhealthfulness of the land; and because of
the nearness of the Chinese, who were not very good neighbors, both for
fear of their insurrections, which were then very frequent, and
because, being idolaters and heathens, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb214" href="#pb214" name="pb214">214</a>]</span>their nearness could,
not but be the cause of much scandal and a poor example to the
collegiates. For these and other like reasons, from the first years
that they were there, our religious began to discuss their removal and
shifting. But, although they called several meetings to discuss the
matter, and several plans were made for that purpose, they were never
realized, for the college was very much in need of funds, for it
scarcely had enough for its maintenance, until the seriousness of the
harm, which was feared from keeping the college outside the city
obliged the piety of this holy province to expend whatever was
necessary for its removal. On the occasion of the death of a lady,
named Do&ntilde;a Maria Ramirez Pinto, who had a new house inside the
city back of the garden of the convent of Santo Domingo, the province
determined to buy it, along with other houses which were near it. It
gave those houses as an alms to the college for that purpose, and
arranging in them all the rooms necessary for a community, with their
church, choir, and belfry; for the licenses which were taken out in the
year 1668 for that removal from the government, city, and
ecclesiastical cabildo expressed such permission. When all the building
was arranged in the form of a college on the above-mentioned day, May
8, of that year 69, the collegiates were transferred to it, with great
pomp and solemnity, amid the joy and gladness of all the
community.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3133src" href="#xd21e3133" name=
"xd21e3133src">7</a> For that was a matter that all desired,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb215" href="#pb215" name=
"pb215">215</a>]</span>as that college had always merited the general
esteem of this city.</p>
<p class="par">And in fact, that college is of great use to this
community, not only as it shelters and rears therein all the orphan and
abandoned boys, but also because any well-raised youth leaves that
college, or seminary, for all walks of life in this community. Some
adopt a military life, others a sea-faring life, and others the
ecclesiastical estate, both monastic and religious, and from them are
regularly supplied most of the curacies of these islands, and other
employments more noteworthy, both in the ecclesiastical and in the
political world. Excellent students leave that college, many of whom
graduate not only with the degree of bachelor, but also with higher
degrees. On the date of this writing, four sons of the college are
living with the dignity of masters and doctors. They are occupied in
honorable posts. Others are also licentiates in the arts. Always in all
times the college has had worthy sons who have honored it, because in
general they are very attentive to study, and observant, of their
obligation, and that fact is well known and believed throughout this
city. It is surely a matter worthy of admiration that they make so
great use of their studies, as they have many other duties <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb216" href="#pb216" name="pb216">216</a>]</span>and
occupations which scarcely allow them time to study; for, besides some
assistancies outside the college, inside it they have duties and so
many employments of devotion, that one does not know when they study
their lessons. In the morning, before or after mass, they recite a
portion of the rosary, and afterward they go to the university. When
they return thence they recite another portion. Also when they return
in the afternoon from the university they recite the last portion of
the rosary with a chanted Salve, and litany. Later in the evening
before supping they also have other devotional duties. This is the
ordinary employment every day. This seems not only not a little
troublesome for a college of students, but also scarcely suitable for
their studies; but this which apparently would be a hindrance and
obstacle to their studies, conduces in reality to their application, or
to the greater clearness with which they study. For, according to the
public understanding and report, they graduate from that college better
prepared than from others; and although they are lads, they attribute
it to the special protection of the most holy Mary, because they recite
to her every day in chorus their whole rosary. All live under that
impression, and accordingly, although they petition for dispensation
from other exercises, they never ask dispensation from that exercise of
the rosary, because they have understood that that is what maintains
them and keeps them in the progress of their studies. As proof of that
I shall relate an event which was but lately told me by a doctor who
was a collegiate of that college. He says that when he left the college
to take up a certain employment, either with the liberty which is
enjoyed outside it, or because of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb217" href="#pb217" name="pb217">217</a>]</span>duties of his
profession, he abandoned the custom, which he had until then observed,
of reciting the whole rosary daily, contenting himself with reciting
only a portion. He entered for the degree in theology, and for the
literary duties annexed to that degree, applied himself very earnestly
to his studies, but with so little fruit of his application that he
could scarcely understand anything that he studied. &ldquo;What is
this,&rdquo; he said in surprise, &ldquo;when I was in college did I
not grasp whatever I studied? But what is this that is happening to me
now that I can scarcely understand what I am studying?&rdquo; Then he
bethought himself of the fact of his error, and he understood the
origin of his lack of intelligence. Consequently, he reformed his past
lukewarmness, and again began to recite the whole rosary daily. By this
diligence alone he found that he could grasp what before he could not
understand. Mary is the most holy mother, not only of the fear and love
of God, but also of learning and knowledge, as she herself says by the
mouth of the Preacher. Consequently, it is not surprising that she
communicates light for intelligence and for progress in their studies
to those who pray to her as her sons and venerate her as a mother, and
praise her in that devotion so pleasing to her.<a class="noteref" id=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The King. Inasmuch as I was informed by my royal
Audiencia of the city of M&eacute;jico, in a letter of May
twenty-seven, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-eight, that the
bachelor, Don Manuel Esteban Sanchez de Tagle, collegiate in the royal
college of San Ildefonso of that city, having attempted to contract
betrothal with Do&ntilde;a Mar&iacute;a Josefa Barrera y Andonaegui,
and his father, Captain Don Manuel Esteban Sanchez de Tagle, having
opposed it, it would be advisable for me to deign to extend to those
dominions the resolutions for these dominions, ordering that
collegiates who are pursuing their studies may not marry without my
royal permission, as their extravagance is regarded as prejudicial to
the state; and inasmuch as the same reason militates there so that they
may not take place without the permission of the viceroy as
vice-patron: I have resolved, after consulting my full Council of the
Indias of the three halls, on November six, one thousand seven hundred

in those dominions. The exact tenor of that law is as follows:
&ldquo;Since the universities, conciliar seminaries, and other colleges
of teaching, erected with public authority in our Indias, are under our
royal patronage and protection; and since their students and pupils
merit the most careful attention, so that they may not disgrace
themselves in their courses and studies with prejudice to the state and
their own families: we order and command such pupils, students, and
members of said universities, conciliar seminaries, and other colleges
and houses, not to contract espousals without, in addition to the
paternal consent, or the consent of the person who ought to give it.
According to the first law of this t&iacute;tulo, they have the
license, those of the conciliar seminaries, of the archbishops and
bishops and vice-patrons, and those of the universities and other
colleges, of our viceroys or presidents of the respective audiencias,
to whom they shall send their petitions or requests by the hand of the
rectors, with report of the latter, since for this matter we delegate
our royal authority to the abovesaid. All of the abovesaid shall be
understood as well in the houses and colleges for women, which are
under our royal protection and patronage. We declare null and void of
all value or effect, betrothals which are contracted without this
requirement, and no judgment or suit can be admitted in regard to their
non-fulfilment in the manner <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb220" href=

the right reverend archbishops and reverend bishops of them, and their
provisors and vicars-general, to observe, perform, and execute, and

exaction: I have resolved in general upon the following, which I send
to you with that superior determination for its fulfilment and
observance in the part touching you.</p>
<p class="par">Manila, March 26, 1803. Since the collection of the
three per cent, assigned to the seminaries in the manner prescribed by
the royal decree of February twenty-two, one thousand seven hundred and
ninety-six, is now determined to include all the parish priests of
these islands with the exception of the hospitals, according to the
declaration of June first, ninety-nine; and that in the cathedral
churches where said seminaries are not established, they be founded,
without prejudice to the fact that the above-mentioned three per cent
shall be collected in the meanwhile, and deposited in a chest with
three keys: it only remains to advise that one of these keys shall be
held in Nueva Segovia, by the bishop of the diocese, another by the
alcalde-mayor, and the third <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb228" href=
"#pb228" name="pb228">228</a>]</span>by the father sacristan placed or
appointed in that church. It is to be noted that the chest shall be
kept in the episcopal palace, and when the see is vacant it will go to
the royal house, where the alcalde-mayor lives, for its due safety.
This same order must be kept in the bishoprics of Ceb&uacute; and
Camarines, and information shall be given in this regard to the
respective bishops; although since the first see is vacant it shall be
given for the present only to his Excellency, Don Fray Domingo
Collantes, who has charge of its government; and in case anything
inconvenient is found in its execution, he shall have the goodness to
inform this superior government in regard to what he should esteem
convenient according to the situation of each church. The three per
cent shall be collected by the alcaldes-mayor of Ilocos, Camarines, and
Ceb&uacute;, as subdelegates of the government, and the proper discount
shall be made for each of the parish priests at the time of paying them
their stipends, and the sum shall be placed in the above-mentioned
chest in the presence of the other keyholders. For that purpose they
shall send to them the proper advice, with the assignment of the day
and hour in which it must be done, at the disposition of his
Excellency, the prelate, and when the see is vacant, to those who shall
have his key. Inasmuch as the amount collected must be placed in said
chest with three keys, as ordered, a balance shall be struck at the end
of each year, in the presence of the three keyholders, and a copy of it
shall be sent by the subdelegates to the general superintendency, with
expression of the assets which are pendent. The governors, corregidors,
and alcaldes-mayor of the other provinces, shall send the amount of
their collections <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb229" href="#pb229"
name="pb229">229</a>]</span>at the order of their respective prelates,
so that in the presence of the other keyholders, the same deposit may
be made. Since it was determined by the above-mentioned royal decree,
the persons who are to have charge of the three keys, so far as this
archbishopric is concerned, are this vice-patron [<i>i.e.</i>, the
governor], his Excellency the archbishop, and the member of the cabildo
who shall be elected; it is only to be noted, in order to avoid any
reason from which any doubt can result prejudicial to this important
object, that the peculiar provision for the collection of the three per
cent corresponding to the curacies of the district, is comprehended in
the preceding article; and by this methodical order, all the governors,
corregidors, and alcaldes-mayor, except those of Ceb&uacute;,
Camarines, and Ilocos, must be guided. For the foundation of the
seminary of Nueva Segovia, the alcalde-mayor shall confer with his
Excellency, the bishop of that diocese, in order that they may select a
site fitting for the extension which should be given to it, with
respect to the number of persons whom it can maintain, and who are
necessary for the discharge of the duties of the bishopric. For that
purpose a plan of the work must be made by experts, and at the same
time its cost must be estimated, so that after it has been sent to the
superior government, with expression of the funds existing in the three
per cent, and of what it is calculated that those funds will yield
annually, the government may take the fitting measures, in order that
the construction may not be undertaken if it must be suspended later
through lack of funds. May God preserve you many years. Manila, March
26, 1803. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb230" href="#pb230" name=

<p class="par first">[The following is taken from <i lang=
"es">Archipi&eacute;lago Filipino</i> (Washington, 1900), i, pp. 343,
344.]</p>
<p class="par">There are five seminaries in Filipinas, corresponding to
the archdiocese of Manila, and to the four suffragan dioceses of
Ceb&uacute;, Jaro, Nueva C&aacute;ceres, and Nueva Segovia, in which
the bishops, in accordance with the terms of the Council of Trent, have
established the training of the secular clergy. They cannot properly be
said to have begun to perform their functions until 1862, when the
fathers of the congregation of St. Vincent of Paul came to these
islands. Those fathers took said seminaries in charge and direct them
at present, with the exception of that of Nueva Segovia, which was in
charge of the calced Augustinian fathers. Before the year 1862, the
majority of the secular clergy was educated in the colleges of Manila,
especially in that of San Juan de Letran, and in that of San
Jos&eacute;....</p>
<p class="par">In all these seminaries, except in that in Manila,
which, because of its proximity to the centers of learning, is limited
to the ecclesiastical studies, are taught Castilian and Latin grammar,
arithmetic and algebra, geometry and trigonometry, physics, logic,
psychology, ethics, metaphysics, and dogmatic and moral theology. They
possess a moderate library, some physical and chemical apparatus, and a
collection of solids for the explanation of mathematics. By means of
matriculation and the official examination, the studies of the
secondary education of the seminaries qualify the students to obtain
the degree <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb231" href="#pb231" name=
"pb231">231</a>]</span>of bachelor of arts, and admission to the
studies of the university.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3287src" href=
"#xd21e3287" name="xd21e3287src">3</a></p>
<p class="par">The expenses of the staff and those for material were
paid from the proceeds of the three per cent collected by the diocesans
from the allowances which a certain part of their clergy received from
the government. In the seminary of Nueva C&aacute;ceres alone, were the
expenses of the staff met by the royal treasury. According to the
statistics of the university, the students of secondary studies in the
seminary of Ceb&uacute;, for the term of 1896&ndash;1897, numbered 504;
those in that of Jaro, 211; those in that of Nueva C&aacute;ceres, 268;
and those in that of Vigan (Nueva Segovia), 201.</p>
<p class="par">[We add the following from <i>Census of Philippines</i>,
iii, pp. 611, 612.]</p>
<p class="par">In order that the branches taught herein, as well as
those taught in private schools, should be considered valid and be
recognized by the university of Santo Tom&aacute;s, it was necessary
that the pupils pay the enrolment and examination fees prescribed by
said university.</p>
<p class="par">The report submitted at the exposition of Amsterdam in
1883, says of these conciliar seminaries: <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb232" href="#pb232" name="pb232">232</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;... The administration of the property is under
the charge of the vicar general of the archbishopric of Manila, and of
the district vicars of the respective rectories, under the supervision
of the bishops. The seminary of [Nueva] Segovia has been in charge of
the Recoletos since the middle of 1876, when the Augustinian friars
left it, and who also had charge since 1882, the Paulist fathers having
the honor of having inaugurated the studies now given. These zealous
priests are those at present in charge of the other
seminaries.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">From statistical tables on file at present in the
archives of Manila, the following facts concerning two of these
conciliar seminaries may be gathered. The enrolment for the seminary of
San Carlos, of Manila, from 1863 to 1886 was 971. The enrolments for
the seminary of Nueva Segovia from 1882 to 1886 were: dogmatic and
moral theology, 171; philosophy, first year, 181, second year, 99, and
third year, 93; Latin grammar, first year, 317, second year, 301, and
third year, 256; Spanish grammar, 275.</p>
<p class="par">Prior to the supervision by the Paulist fathers, the
studies of secondary instruction, which were given in the conciliar
seminaries, were identical with those given by the friars in their
other educational institutions, in substance as well as in form, as the
purposes were the same&mdash;that is, to give education to Filipino
clerics,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3314src" href="#xd21e3314" name=
"xd21e3314src">4</a> whom they always considered <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb233" href="#pb233" name=
"pb233">233</a>]</span>their rivals and political enemies.... For this
reason the instruction given to the Filipinos, who aspired to a
sacerdotal career, was incomplete, being reduced exclusively to
rudiments, if they can be so called, of logic, psychology, ethics,
metaphysics, and dogmatic and moral theology. In so far as political
and social studies were concerned, absolutely nothing was given, and
clerics were even forbidden to acquire knowledge of this character.
Social education was unknown in these seminaries; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb234" href="#pb234" name="pb234">234</a>]</span>no
consideration was given to the fact that clerics, on account of their
obligations and the constant intercourse they are obliged to have with
their parishioners, should be the best educated men, with great
knowledge of the ways of the world and of the human heart. The moral
education of the Filipino people, especially that of the women, often
retrogressed, and made absolutely no progress on account of the
influence caused by the status of the Filipino clerics in the popular
mind.</p>
<p class="par">After the conciliar seminaries passed to the charge of
the Paulist fathers, affairs continued in the same manner, because
these priests were subject and subordinate to the rigid tutorship of
the monastic orders and the universitarian feudalism which the
Dominican friars exercised in the Philippine Islands, and it was not
possible for them to develop their own initiative, or to explain their
own opinions....</p>
<p class="par">[<i lang="es">Doctrina y reglas constitucionales de la

<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb235" href="#pb235" name=
"pb235">235</a>]</span>following in regard to seminaries, which are
analogous to conciliar seminaries.]</p>
<p class="par">The first duties of our bishops consist in establishing
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb236" href="#pb236" name=
"pb236">236</a>]</span>a good seminary in their respective dioceses,
which may serve as a training-school for new priests, educated
according to the new doctrines of the independent Filipino church.</p>
<p class="par">They shall exercise their whole care in seeking a
suitable although modest locality, and in catechising as many young men
as possible, who are fit for the lofty ministry of God. We desire that
not only our church, but more than anyone else the most reverend
bishops themselves recognize the great necessity for these seminaries.
Consequently, their negligence in this particular will be very fatal,
and merit censure.</p>
<p class="par">The effort shall be made to give the young men a
complete instruction, one concise and more nutritive than that of the
interminable years of unnecessary dissertations and fruitless
&ldquo;therefores,&rdquo; with which the Roman priests feed the best
years of our youth.</p>
<p class="par">The plan of studies shall be based on the principle that
we must begin to learn the most necessary, secondly, the most useful,
and thirdly, the sciences that ought to always adorn the worthy priests
of God. The plan recommended in the fourth epistle of our church shall
be followed.</p>
<p class="par">But knowledge will be vain and useless in a priest, if
he is not adorned with the Christian virtues of holiness, altruism,
obedience, and zeal for the greater glory of God. Consequently, the
young men shall be instructed in the practice of an ascetic and
disciplined life, and they shall become accustomed to prayer, the
sacraments, and the exercises of evangelization.</p>
<p class="par">Adjoined to the seminaries, the effort shall be
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb237" href="#pb237" name=
"pb237">237</a>]</span>made to create Catholic schools and colleges for
both sexes. Thus the selection of priests will become more easy; and
furthermore, [this shall be done] inasmuch as it is of great importance
for us to teach the divine teachings of Jesus Christ and the redeeming
doctrines of our church to the children.</p>
<p class="par">[Pp. 42, 43, of the same rules, contain the
following:]</p>
<p class="par">The chief bishop shall contrive ways and means, now by
imposing a tax among the parish priests, now by begging alms for the
support and creation of Catholic seminaries and colleges, which are
very necessary for the propagation and defense of our church; as well
as to comply with our most sacred obligation of evangelizing the
heathen tribes, and satisfy other considerations of the
subsecretaryship of the propaganda of the faith.</p>
<p class="par">In all other things not covered by these rules, the
chief bishop shall have power to decree, provided that he do not
violate the spirit of the same, after obtaining the opinion of the
superior economical Council.</p>
<p class="par">[The plan of studies above-mentioned is found on pp. 67,
68, of the same book, and is as follows:]</p>
<p class="par">5. The diocesan committees shall exert their efforts
very earnestly in creating with all haste, seminaries, in order to be
able to provide all the parishes with young and learned priests, since
the scarcity of priests is the principal pretext of the Roman priests,
in order that they may introduce foreign priests here. They shall
endeavor to attract as great a number of students as possible, with the
assurance that in two years&rsquo; time only they will be given a
complete, concise, and more nutritive instruction than the interminable
years of unnecessary <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb238" href="#pb238"
name="pb238">238</a>]</span>dissertations and fruitless
&ldquo;therefores&rdquo; with which the friars feed the best years of
our young men, in order by that method to hinder the multiplication and
true education of our priests.</p>
<p class="par">The plan of studies which shall be followed for the
present shall be as follows:</p>
<p class="par"><i>Baccalaureate</i></p>
<p class="par">If the students are very young, they shall have to pass
in all the courses of secondary instruction. But if they are twenty
years old, only the following courses shall be demanded of them:</p>
<p class="par">English or Spanish, geography, history, arithmetic,
natural sciences (natural history, physics, and chemistry), and
rhetoric.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Priesthood</i></p>
<p class="par">1st year: Bible and theology simplified.</p>
<p class="par">2d year: Amplification of the preceding course, and
application of the Bible to all the problems of life, social and
private, to the ceremonies and to the priestly life, and to
ecclesiastical discipline.</p>
<p class="par">By simply passing these courses, and if the good
deportment of the students be proved, they shall be ordained as
presbyters and placed in the parish churches.</p>
<p class="par">But not on that account shall they cease to continue
their studies, and as is now the custom among the Roman priests, they
shall be examined annually, to determine whether they are fit to
continue the duties of priest, in the following manner.</p>
<p class="par">1st year: History of religions.</p>
<p class="par">2d year: Study of the distinct philosophical and
theological systems.</p>
<p class="par">3d year: Canons. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb239"

<p class="par">4th year: The studies of the baccalaureate which they

Cuartero, the first bishop of the diocese. The building is of stone

Paulist priests, and two lay-brothers in charge of the institution, who
are aided by three native clerics&mdash;pupils in the same seminary,
who teach the Latin classes under the direction of the rector. The
following fees are charged: matriculation, four pesos; boarding pupils,
nine pesos per month, payable quarterly; and the three per cent of the

years of Latin, and three of philosophy. The total number of pupils

Blumentritt says of the relations between the religious orders and the
Philippine clergy: &ldquo;They [<i>i.e.</i>, the orders] won for
themselves in early times, great gratitude from the natives by
protecting them from the government officials, which was increased by
admitting them to religious orders. But this happy condition was
changed in the present century, for when the orders were abolished in
Spain, the Philippines offered an asylum to the crowd of European
novices, whose numbers soon barred further admission to the natives.
Since that time the Philippine friars have been European Spaniards, who
are often the only white men in the country districts, and who, being
the only representatives of the ruling race, have made use of that
position, in fact, if not with right, and constituted themselves the
rulers of the land. In the fear that a liberal government might deprive
them of their last refuge&mdash;the Philippines&mdash;by handing the
parishes over to the (native) secular clergy, the Spanish friars began
to pose as the only reliable support of Spanish rule in the
archipelago, and to throw the suspicion of independence upon the
secular clergy. So great is the ignorance of the Spaniards of the
affairs of the archipelago, that this suggestion was easily
entertained, although all insurrections have been suppressed, not by
the friars, but by the government. Their power was further increased by
the money they circulated in Spain, and the fear of the Spanish
government that they might place their wealth at the disposal of the
Carlists.</p>
<p class="par footnote">&ldquo;These friars have been the enemies of
every administrative reform which the colonial ministers have promised
or effected from 1868 until the present time, and they have
consequently and naturally appealed as the enemies of all progress and
improvement in their country, not only to the secular clergy, but also
to all the other inhabitants of the islands.... What kind of a spirit
actuated them is best shown by the fact that they accused the Jesuits,
who are highly esteemed, of liberalism, and so brought suspicion and
distrust upon the teachers who were educated in the Jesuit
teachers&rsquo; seminary.&rdquo; See <i>Census of Philippines</i>, iii,

Aglipay, the founder of the new Filipino Church, is an Ilokano by birth
and is about forty years old. He was educated for the priesthood in a
Catholic seminary, and ordained about 1890. His rise was rapid, for he
was well looked upon by Spanish ecclesiastics. In the early pair of
American occupation, however, he was excommunicated for some Church
irregularity, &ldquo;an action ... glaringly unjust and entirely
irregular,&rdquo; says Stuntz. Thereupon he joined the insurgents and
was made vicar-general by Aguinaldo. Shortly after the proclamation of
April 4, 1899, by the Schurman commission, he took the oath of
allegiance to the United States. In August, 1901, he had private
conferences with several Protestant ministers regarding the religious
condition of the Philippines, and declared his intention to head a
movement for an independent church, asking the co&ouml;peration of the
Protestants. The constitution was adopted in October, 1902, at a
convention of the priests and laymen who had joined the movement, and
Aglipay was elected archbishop. The movement spread rapidly. In north
Ilokos but three priests with their churches remained loyal to Rome.
Various estimates place the number of adherents to the new faith at
1,500,000, or 2,000,000, although they themselves claim 3,000,000. The
question of their right to hold church property came up early, and
Governor Taft ruled that the party which is in peaceful possession of
any house of worship shall be deemed to be the rightful occupant, and
the contrary must be proved in the courts before ejection can take
place. More than 200 priests have joined the movement, and young native
priests are being ordained with somewhat startling ease and
carelessness, in the seminaries which the new Church has opened. The
foremost priests and laymen have been open enemies of the United
States, and some of them still advocate independence. Isabelo de los
Reyes, a politician of the demagogue type, is one of the active leaders
of the movement. A weekly paper is published in the interests of the
new Church. Patriotism rather than religion is the reason for its rapid
growth, so that its basis with many is political. The fear of the
return of the friars was seized upon by the schismatics to gain new
adherents. Homer C. Stuntz says: &ldquo;Its easy program of religious
reformations attracts thousands. It promises a better order of things,
but makes no spiritual or moral demands. Priests may come into the
movement, and keep their mistresses and continue their gambling.
Aglipay himself has never been accused of immorality or gaming, but he
sets up no standard of purity in his priesthood or among his people.
The cockpit, games of cards and dice, the <i>bino</i> habit, and all
other national vices come into the new Church without direct rebuke.
This, its real weakness, gives it apparent strength. Because of this it
is enabled to count its members by the million within less than two
years from its birth.&rdquo; Protestant influence is seen on every
hand. Protestant missionaries congratulate themselves that the Catholic
front of the islands is broken by this movement. The office of bishop
is elective, Aglipay himself being included by this rule.
Stuntz&rsquo;s conclusions are as follows: &ldquo;The Independent
Filipino Catholic Church has come to stay. Just how strong a hold it
will be able to keep over the multitudes which have flocked to its
standard of revolt against the pope cannot be foretold. But it may be
reckoned with as a permanent factor in the religious future of the
Philippines.&rdquo; See LeRoy&rsquo;s <i>Philippine Life</i>, pp.
163&ndash;171; Homer C. Stuntz&rsquo;s <i>The Philippines and the Far
East</i> (Cincinnati and New York, 1905), pp. 488&ndash;496; and
<i>Report of Philippine Commission</i>, 1904, i, pp. 19,

Majesty, dated January 1, 1820, was ruled by the regulations of 1837,
which were modified by the royal order of October 19, 1860. In this
school was studied the profession of pilot of merchant marine. The
theoretical teaching was given in it in four years&rsquo;
time;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3463src" href="#xd21e3463" name=

<p class="par">The total number of pupils was usually fifty or sixty.
They were mostly Indians, who, as they did not master the Spanish
language, did not derive all the profit which would have been reported
under other circumstances, and many of them after the knowledge
acquired in the first two courses, chose a more lucrative
profession.</p>
<p class="par">At first it was supported with its own funds and under
the direction of the Board and Tribunal of Commerce, but later, upon
the suppression of the Board and Tribunal, the school and its funds
passed under the control of the state, which furnished its expenses,
and gave the administrative direction to the commandant-general of the

was also at Manila, for many years, a military academy for the
education of the sons of military men residing in the colony, as well
as for soldiers and non-commissioned officers who desired to fit
themselves for promotion. The son of a native needed great influence to
enable him to enter, and such had generally to enlist as a soldier,
more especially since the age-limit was lowered. Formerly, when the
scale of ages was different in the colonies from the scale in Spain,
officers graduated from this academy, but later when the scales were
made uniform, this academy was closed, and opened again afterward under
different conditions. Its candidates were eligible candidates for
admission to the general military academy of Spain at Toledo, which
annually gave notice to the academy of the number of scholars which it
could accommodate. Many Filipinos took advantage of this and became
efficient military men. The instruction given in the academy seems to
have been superior to that afforded in many of the other institutions,
and examinations were comparatively strict. Annual attendance was
generally about 100. Since American occupation a military academy has
been suggested for the Filipinos. See <i>Report of Philippine
Commission</i>, 1900, i, p. 40, 1900&ndash;1903, p. 128; and <i>Report

the oldest educational institution of the Philippines under the
supervision of the Bureau of Education. The building of the school was
destroyed by the earthquake of 1863. A nautical school was opened by
the American government in Manila, December 15, 1899, with an enrolment
of 22 pupils, and under the superintendency of Lieut. Commander V. S.
Cottman, U.S.N., who was assisted by three instructors. He was relieved
by Lieut. George F. Cooper, December 25, 1899. The course of
instruction was at first for three years. At the beginning of the new
term in June, 1900, four more instructors were appointed. There were
five instructors at the opening of the first term in 1901. The
instruction was first in Spanish, but for the sake of greater
efficiency English was substituted. In July, 1901, the school opened
with 83 pupils. In October, 1901, the course was extended to four
years. The studies include English, mathematics, history, drawing,
mechanics, and practical seamanship. The method of instruction and
discipline are based upon those of the United States Naval Academy. The
building, although well equipped in many ways, is not itself adequate
for the purpose for which it is used. The school has not attained the
excellence desired, due in part to the irregular attendance and lack of
discipline, although attendance continues to increase. See <i>Report of
the Commissioner of Education</i> (Department of the Interior), 1901,

<p class="par first">This school, whose chief end was to furnish good
soprano voices for the singing in the holy cathedral church of Manila,
was founded in 1742 by the right reverend Se&ntilde;or Rodriguez,
archbishop of these islands, and it has subsisted and still subsists
with the same property from the pious bequest of its foundation.</p>
<p class="par">It consists of a director and a teacher of primary
instruction, both priests; one teacher of singing, chanting, and
vocalization; another of the piano, organ, and composition; and another
of stringed instruments. The children sopranos number eighteen, though
at times there have been more, and all have been supported, clothed,
and, as well, frequently assisted in the career which they have desired
to adopt.</p>
<p class="par">The musical instruction given to those boys is according
to the methods pursued in the conservatory of Madrid; for singing and
harmony, Eslava; for the piano, Aranguren; for the organ, Gimeno; for
the violin, its method and studies, Alard; and for vocalization,
Romero.</p>
<p class="par">Because of the tender age of these boys, since they
enter at the age of six or eight years, and remain until that of
fourteen, they are not permitted, except <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

to play wind instruments. The gain due to this institution is public
and well known to all who have heard the harmony produced by those
sopranos in the churches of Manila, and the skill demonstrated by the
same in instrumental music for almost three centuries past. Not few of
them have been justly praised and rewarded in musical contests where
they were presented, for example, in the <i lang="es">Liceo

<p class="par first">Primary instruction cannot be considered in a
backward state, and, indeed, I believe that, in proportion, there are
more persons who can read and write in these islands than in
Espa&ntilde;a, and in some [other] civilized countries.<a class=

of sowing and of harvest. The master, and other expenses, are paid from
the communal fund. In view of this I have wondered at seeing in many
foreigners the strange belief that the government does not permit the
learning of reading and writing; for I can assert that, in the archives
of Manila I have found many old and recently-dictated decrees, with a
spirit diametrically the contrary, which repeatedly enjoin the teaching
of the Castilian language. Women also share in this benefit, and I have
found girls who lived not only far from the capital, but in an isolated
house distant from the village, and, notwithstanding, they had learned
to read and write. One must confess, however, that they scarcely know
other books than those of devotion, especially a poem entitled the
<i lang="es">Pasion de Cristo</i> [<i>i.e.</i>, Passion of Christ].

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">This college was founded at the beginning of the
seventeenth century; their Excellencies, Benavides and Soria, the one
archbishop of Manila, and the other bishop of Nueva Segovia, giving
their libraries for that purpose, and, in addition, the former giving
1,000 pesos and the latter 1,800. Already finished in 1619, it was
admitted as a house of the province of Preachers in the islands, as
appears from the records of the intermediary chapter celebrated in
Santo Domingo, April 20, with the suitable license of the superior
government and of the ordinary. In 1620 it already had lecturers and
masters for public teaching, and November 27, 1623, his Majesty
admitted it under his royal protection. It was erected into a
university at the instance of the said monarch Felipe IV, by a bull of
Innocent X, November 20, 1645, which was passed by the supreme Council
of Indias July 28, 1646. By a decree of May 17, 1680, the university
was received under the royal protection, his Majesty declaring himself
its patron. In consequence of another decree of December 7, 1781, the
rules were made, which, approved by the superior government October 20,
1786 as they were prepared are those which are in force at present.
Their cloister is composed of various doctors, licentiates, and
masters, although in reality only twenty-one of the first and second
kinds form it. The number of collegiates is ruled by circumstances, and
the college supports them, for they have to dress and provide shoes for
many. Their funds are ministered by lay-brother religious. This college
and royal university is in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb250" href=

native law. In this university 581 students are studying, who are

<h3 class="main">COLLEGE OF SAN JOSE</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">By a decree of June 8, 1585, his Majesty ordered
the establishment of a college to be attempted in Manila, in which the
sons of the Spanish inhabitants might be instructed in virtue and
letters under the direction of the Jesuit fathers. But, although the
governor Dasmari&ntilde;as enacted an edict for that purpose, it was
not fulfilled until the year 1601 when the college of San Jos&eacute;
was instituted in some houses next to the house of the Jesuits. There
were thirteen collegiates when it was first opened, but in a short time
their number reached twenty. Among the first was a nephew of Governor
Tello, a son of Dr. Morga, senior auditor, and other sons of
influential citizens. At the beginning the collegiates contributed a
certain sum for their own support, but soon there were greater means.
One of the most considerable was the endowment left in his will by the
illustrious gentleman, Don Esteban Rodriguez de Figueroa, governor of
Mindanao, who was recognized as patron of the college. In 1605, Father
Pedro Montes became rector, he founded the chair <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb251" href="#pb251" name="pb251">251</a>]</span>of
scholastic theology, and promoted those of philosophy and Latin,
selecting to take charge of them the most pronounced men of talent of
his Society. During the reign of Felipe IV, the latter obtained from
his Holiness, Gregory XV, authority to concede solemn degrees in
philosophy and theology. The latter&rsquo;s bull and the royal decree
of concession were celebrated in Manila by a public procession, and
when they were presented to the most illustrious Serrano, then
archbishop, he offered obedience and observance on his part. February
18, 1707, his Majesty continued for six years the assignment that had
been made to the college of 400 pesos, and 400 fanegas of rice. May 3,
1722, the title of &ldquo;Royal&rdquo; was conceded to the college.
November 15, 1747, the enjoyment of an encomienda in the villages of
Sul&aacute;t and Tavig, in the province of Samar, was also continued
for ten years. February 3, 1748, his Majesty confirmed in favor of this
college the lands of the estates of Mariquina and San Pedro
Yunas&aacute;n. At present it possesses that estate and the estate of
San Juan de Lian, which are administered by the rector. With their
products the college takes care of the support of twenty-two
collegiates, the house and food of the vice-rector and masters, and the
annual pay given to them and to the rector. They also admit capistas
who pay fifty pesos per year, and receive public teaching therein in
philosophy, rhetoric, and Latin. From the expulsion of the Jesuits
until the year 1777 this institution was closed.</p>

supreme Council of the Indias by the government of these islands, and
later his Majesty recommended it to Governors Fajardo and Corcuera.
Before dying, the aged Guerrero took the habit as lay-brother in [the
convent of] Santo Domingo, and made that order a formal bequest of his
advanced charitable work. Later it was erected into a college and
received under the royal protection, his Majesty conceding it some
encomiendas, or annuities for its support. At present it maintains at
its own cost twenty-one Spanish orphan lads, with the 600 pesos to
which amounts the product of the annuities which are collected from the
alcalde-mayor of Pangasinan by a Dominican religious. It also receives
Indian and mestizo collegiates who pay fifty pesos per year apiece for
their support. Their number is not fixed. Under the title of sacristan,
porters, librarians, and other mechanical trades, there are various
people who pay nothing. Their studies are carried on in the university
of Santo Tom&aacute;s, except that of grammar. At the present time this
college has 239 students, counting orphans, capistas and others.</p>

which were to maintain so useful an institution, but being drawn upon,
as was the general rule, those funds had the same fate as other large
sums of the commerce and charitable funds of this capital, and were
lost through the political happenings of the kingdom of Mexico. The
assembly having been extinguished for lack of funds, the city took
under its charge the charity school. Reading, writing, Christian
doctrine, Spanish grammar, and slate-work arithmetic are taught there.
The pupils must be Spanish; the children of rich people pay two pesos

admission, a ticket from the president of the dissolved assembly was
sufficient. Now it is given by the regidor, who is serving his turn in

<p class="par">There is no copy of the first rules of this school in
existence, for they probably perished with its archives, and ten or
twelve inmates in the awful earthquake of 1645, which overthrew the
edifice and destroyed the greater part of the city. In fulfilment
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb256" href="#pb256" name=
"pb256">256</a>]</span>of a royal order of November 27, 1686, and
superior rulings of March 15, 1691, Doctor Silva, then chaplain of said
school, published, in the following April, the ordinances of Santa
Potentiana, which merited royal approbation November 14, 1825, in which
year the newly printed rules were ordered to be observed.</p>
<p class="par">In 1736 the free inmates were the daughters of Spaniards
who had served his Majesty in the islands. They were aided with what
was necessary for their support and clothing, and the physician and the
medicine for the sick were paid for them, besides a suitable funeral
for the dead. The funds of the college did not permit, in case one
married, to give her a suitable dowry, but such a one received two
hundred pesos from the charitable fund which was established for that
purpose in 1686 by Don Crist&oacute;bal Romero, castellan of the fort
of Santiago, and in the time of Governor Tamon, fifty pesos more, which
he gave from his own purse, to each one of the inmates when she was
married. In 1729, Auditor Don Jos&eacute; Antonio Pabon founded for the
same purpose another charitable fund by giving 2,823 pesos, which the
royal treasury owed him on account of pay, but that foundation had no
effect until 1749. The funds were in charge of the managers, who very
commonly were the royal officials, and were increased by investing them
suitably, until the time when they entered the royal treasury with the
other incomes of the school. At present that school occupies a house
which was bought at the royal account, for its ancient site has been
destined for the building of a fortification. From the same treasury,
the expenses of a small chapel, a physician, apothecary shop,
infirmary, clothing for the pupils, and six <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb257" href="#pb257" name=

700 pesos annually; and those of a sacristan, four <i lang=
"es">faginantes</i> [<i>i.e.</i>, fagot-gatherers], and one purchaser.
By a provision of the Superior Board of the royal treasury of September
22, 1808, money was subscribed for the maintenance of a rectress, a
portress, and twenty-four inmates at the rate of one and one-half reals
per day to each one, and monthly from the royal magazines, 46 baskets

many poor Spanish orphan girls who were reared in Santa Potenciana, and
in private houses; but having bought an edifice in which to gather
them, the foundation of this school was accomplished at the end of the
year 1632. It is in the immediate charge and care of the purveyor. The
first rules for its government were made in 1650, and they were
retained with some slight alterations until 1813. In that year they
were entirely revised, and these latter are the ones which are observed
at present. It has a chapel which is kept very neat and clean, which is

<p class="par first">It was begun in 1719 by four Filipino girls, who
gave themselves exclusively to the service of God, and that of the
Virgin of Carmel. In 1735 the beaterio was given form at the petition
of the Recollect provincial, Fray Andres de San Fulgencio. The beatas
were permitted to take the habit as manteletas of the discalced
Augustinians. Their number was not to exceed twelve, and the
institution was to remain subject to the vice-patron. In 1754, a
measure was started as to whether the beatas ought to pay tribute or
not, and the custom which favors the negative was ordered to be
followed. They live in community without any vow. Each year they
nominate one prioress. They are sustained by alms and by their own
work. The priorate of San Sebastian contributes 100 cavans of palay,
and 300 pesos annually, because the beatas sew the scapularies of
Carmel, wash the clothes of the Church, and of the religious resident
therein; and the convent of Manila 200 cavans and 300 pesos more for
the washing of the clothes of the sacristy and of the religious. Orphan
girls are received and are taught reading, writing, the Christian
doctrine, sewing, etc. For the very little girls the beaterio receives
what their relatives care to give. Those who can work pay nothing if
they work; but if they do not work they pay three or four pesos per
month according to their circumstances. Some Spanish women also enter
for the [religious] exercises. At present this beaterio has 12 beatas,
24 larger girls who are being educated, 16 smaller ones, and one little
girl boarder, with some <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb260" href=

whom pay four pesos monthly for their support, and some two or three
pesos, but these latter assist in the kitchen and washing once a week.
This institution is supported by the alms and by the products of some
sewing and by the washing of clothes. Every year there are exercises
held there which begin in October; those who attend it are Filipino
women. They are divided into three shifts, and about 300 of them
assemble, each of whom pays two pesos. From that sum they meet the
expenses of preachers, confessors, and their support. Since the
expulsion of the Jesuits, this beaterio has been under the direction of
the provisor of the archbishopric, and for lack of a shelter-house, it
supplies its place. The object of the foundation was that Filipino
girls might be reared in it and taught embroidery, sewing, reading, and

<p class="par first">In this village there is a house of teaching, or a
beaterio entitled Santa Rita, which was founded in 1740 with the
necessary licenses by the calced Augustinian, Fray Felix de Trillo,
then parish priest of Pasig. Its primary object is to provide shelter
for Filipino orphan girls, and to teach them reading, writing,
Christian doctrine, sewing, embroidery, and other employments fitting
for their sex. They dress when they go to the parish church in the
habit of mantelates of St. Augustine, but they take no vow or
obligation. Those educated and sheltered dress as in their own homes.
This beaterio is sustained by the work of their hands and by alms,
under the care and solicitous management of the parish priests. The
latter are not those who give the least alms for its useful
preservation, and that from the product of some estates which they have
rented out, and which they acquired by their economy. Furthermore, the
young women who enter as wards pay when their relatives are able,
according to their wealth, up to the sum of two pesos per month. That
is the greatest fee, but it is more usual for each one who is educated
to contribute a few cavans of palay per year&mdash;generally
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb262" href="#pb262" name=

writing in 1869, says of education among the natives. &ldquo;The
Christian Spaniard has not been able to exert much more influence of a
spiritual than of a political nature upon the character of the natives.
Popular education was formerly, and is now, entirely in the hands of
the priests. Excepting the professors of common and Roman law all the
chairs of the University of Santo Tom&aacute;s of Manila are in the
hands of the priests, who naturally arrange not only the theological
lectures, but those upon metaphysics, physics, and logic, as well,
according to the principles of the Catholic Church. In the provinces
every village has its public schools in which instruction is
obligatory; but, besides reading and writing, only Christian doctrine
and church music are taught. This instruction, moreover, is by no means
generally given in Spanish; at least, the general introduction of
Spanish is still so recent that it will be long before the Spanish
officials will be able to converse, even with their subordinates, in
Spanish. On the east coast of Mindanao, one of the oldest and most
settled provinces, the native dialect was exclusively used until forty
or fifty years ago, and the priests used the old Malay alphabet until
the beginning of the century, even in their official business. The
number of natives&mdash;the Spaniards call them
&lsquo;Indians&rsquo;&mdash;who can read and write is tolerably large,
but owing to the total unreliability of all statistics on the subject,
nothing accurate can be stated. In 1863 the Government attempted to
make an enumeration of the population, and, incidentally, to note the
number of those who could read and write. The fact that the result was
never published seems to confirm the opinion that an unsatisfactory
condition of things was found.&rdquo; See <i>Census of Philippines</i>,

late Spanish domination, there were 67 private Latin schools in the
archipelago, of which 23 were in the province of Manila, and nearly all
the others in Luz&oacute;n. In the term of 1886&ndash;87, there were 41
private schools, of secondary instruction, twelve of which were in the
suburbs of Manila, two in the walled city, and the rest in the
provinces of Luz&oacute;n and the Visayas. Of the 41 professors in
charge thereof, only one had the degree of doctor, eight were
licentiates, and the rest held the degree of bachelor of arts. The
course of study in these schools included Latin and Spanish grammar,
Christian doctrine and sacred history, general geography and geography
of Spain and the Philippines, Latin translation and analysis,
elementary Greek, general history and history of Spain and the
Philippines, arithmetic and algebra, rhetoric and poetry, geometry and
plane trigonometry, and French. The attendance in 1895&ndash;96 was
1,915. They were under the charge of licentiates, in philosophy or
science, or bachelors of arts who must have passed a teacher&rsquo;s
examination, and were under inspectors, one of whom was appointed by
the rector of the university, who was ex-officio head of all the
schools of the islands. Some of the schools had a one-year course,
others two, and others three. The teachers were Filipinos. The
supervisors of public instruction had the power to visit the schools,
and recommend their establishment or removal. The pupils were required
to enrol and be examined in the university, except those in distant
provinces, who could be examined by a board composed of the
alcalde-mayor, the parish priest, and the respective professor. The
result of the examination was sent to the secretary of the university.
The Dominicans had one private school at Dagupan (Pangasin&aacute;n),
founded 1890&ndash;91; the Franciscans, that of Guinobatan (Albay),
founded 1894&ndash;95; and the Recollects that of Bac&oacute;lod
(Negros Occidental), founded 1895. There are still a number of private
schools in the archipelago. During recent years many have sprung up in
Manila and the provinces which give primary and secondary education,
although the instruction is generally poor. Some of them have been
started in answer to the complaint of some Filipino parents that the
American schools are godless; some have been started by Roman Catholic
priests for the purpose of combating purely secular instruction; and
some are the expression of Filipino nationality and independence.
Within ten months, since June, 1901, 29 new private schools were opened
in Manila alone. They are generally patterned after the old method, and
are either teaching in Spanish or the vernacular. The popular demand
for English has compelled many of them to make a show of teaching it,
but it is generally being attempted without adequate teachers. It was
suggested that the curriculum in such schools, except in matters of
religious instruction, conform to the course of the public schools, and
that they be under the official inspection, such a course making it
possible to have a real compulsory school law. The Liceo de Manila is a
school organized and run by Filipinos. The late C. J. Zulueta was
professor of history in this school and read an address at its opening,
June 19, 1902. See LeRoy&rsquo;s <i>Philippine Life</i>, pp. 223, 224;

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">At the head of the public instruction in the
Philippines, one finds the university of Manila, called <span lang=
"es">La Real y Pontificia Universidad de Santo Tomas</span>
[<i>i.e.</i>, the royal and pontifical university of Santo
Tom&aacute;s]. Its foundation as a college goes back to the first year
of the seventeenth century. Its first benefactors were Archbishop
Benavides of Manila, and Bishop Soria of Nueva Segovia. Both of them
made it a gift of their library, and, in addition, the first one gave
it 1,000 pesos and the second 1,800. In 1619, the house was entrusted
to the religious of the Order of St. Dominic. The following year the
courses of public instruction were opened there. Finally, on November
27, 1623, King Felipe IV took it under his special protection. In the
year 1645, the same monarch obtained a bull from Pope Innocent X, which
erected the college of Santo Tom&aacute;s of Manila into a university.
The statutes governing that institution today were not drawn up until a
long time after, that is to say, in the year 1781. Instruction there is
entrusted to the doctors, licentiates, and masters (<i lang=
"es">maestros</i>). At the present time there are 21, both <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb264" href="#pb264" name=
"pb264">264</a>]</span>doctors and licentiates, and no masters. Latin,
logic, physics, metaphysics, ethics, canon law, and theology are taught
there. In addition to that, some time afterward there was founded a
chair of Roman law and one of Spanish law. The number of students who
attend that university is now 581, namely, sixty-one collegiates,
fifteen capistas, who are maintained at the expense of the college, and
505 day students.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3833src" href="#xd21e3833"
name="xd21e3833src">1</a> The costume of the collegiates is a long robe
of green silk with black, sleeves, a <i>beca</i>, a kind of red scarf
folded in two parts and crossing over the breast and drawn up behind
the shoulders, a black collar with a white border and a cap like that
worn by the law advocates of Spain.</p>
<p class="par">If the university of Manila is the chief institution of
public instruction, it is not the most ancient. From June 8, 1585, the
king had ordered the foundation of a college, in which the sons of the
Spanish inhabitants of the archipelago might be reared in the love of
virtue and letters under the direction of the fathers of the Society of
Jesus. But it was only in 1601 that that order could be carried out by
the institution of the college of San Jos&eacute;. The first
collegiates numbered 13, but that number was soon raised to 20, all of
whom were the sons or the near relatives of the first authorities of
the country. Pope Gregory XV granted that college the right of
conferring degrees of philosophy and theology. The funds of that
institution are drawn from several estates, which have been conceded to
it at different times. They are sufficient to provide for the
maintenance of the vice-rector and of the masters, in the annual pay
which is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb265" href="#pb265" name=
"pb265">265</a>]</span>granted to them, as well as to the rector, and
for the maintenance of 22 free pupils. Some pay students are also
admitted there at the rate of 50 piastres [<i>i.e.</i>, pesos] per
year. Philosophy, rhetoric, and Latin are taught there. Upon the
suppression of the Society of Jesus, that college was closed until
1777. The costume of the students is a red gown with black sleeves and
a black cap.</p>
<p class="par">The college of San Juan de Letran commenced by being a
primary school, founded in 1630 at the expense of a charitable man,
whose name, Juan Ger&oacute;nimo Guerrero, deserves to pass to
posterity. He consecrated himself to gathering together in that
institution young orphan boys, and to teaching them reading, writing,
and the Christian doctrine. He was also able, thanks to the abundant
alms which the inhabitants of Manila put into his hands, to provide for
the maintenance and clothing of all those children. Before dying that
kind-hearted man took the habit of St. Dominic, and entrusted the pious
foundation which he had undertaken into the hands of that order. The
latter erected it into a college, for which it obtained the protection
of the king and some funds for its support. By means of a sum of 600
piastres which the alcalde of Pangasinan is charged to give annually to
a Dominican who collects it, that college supports gratuitously 25
orphan boys. It also admits an unlimited number of boarders, both
Indians and mestizos, who pay 50 piastres per year. It finally receives
under the name of sacristans, porters, librarians, etc., several young
students who do not pay anything. The total number of those who receive
education in that college under different titles is today 239 persons.

<p class="par">The charity school (<i lang="es">escuela pia</i>) of
Manila was established in 1817 under the direction of a special
assembly composed of distinguished inhabitants, in the number of which
there was a member of the chapter of the cathedral, and one of the
tribunal of commerce. The inhabitants who had assembled supplied the
funds which were to serve for the maintenance of that useful
establishment. But those funds having been used in trade according to
custom they had the same fortune that so many other considerable sums
and charitable foundations of that capital have had, namely, they were
lost because of the revolution of Mexico. The assembly, being dissolved
on account of lack of funds, the city took the charity school under its
charge. Reading, writing, Christian doctrine, Spanish grammar, and
slate arithmetic, are taught there. The pupils must be Spaniards; the
sons of well-to-do parents pay 2 piastres per month; those who are less
well-to-do, 1 piastre; and the poor pay nothing. In order to be
admitted there a ticket from the president of the dissolved assembly
was sufficient. At present the regidor is charged in his turn with the
management of the establishment which delivers the ticket. The number
of pupils at the present time is 50, of whom 26 receive instruction
free.</p>
<p class="par">In pursuance of reiterated instances from the tribunal
of commerce a marine school was opened in Manila in 1820, by royal
authorization. Arithmetic, the elements of geometry, rectilinear, and
spherical trigonometry, cosmography, and piloting, besides practical
geometry applied to the making <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb267"
href="#pb267" name="pb267">267</a>]</span>of hydrographical maps and
plans, with the manner of designing them, were taught there. The whole,
conformed to the course of study for the navy, was composed, according
to the order of the king, by the chief of the royal fleet, Don Gabriel
Ciscar. The expenses of the institution are supplied by the funds
called <i lang="es">aver&iacute;a</i>. The tribunal of commerce decides
as to the admission of pupils and those who distinguish themselves on
graduating to become captains of trading ships, making the voyage to
China and India, and even going as far as America and to Europa. This
proves that, whatever the Spaniards say of it, the young men of Manila
are as susceptible to instruction as those of the mother country. In
fact, there is no doubt that if the studies of this school were more
solid and less theoretical, most remarkable persons would be seen to
graduate from it.</p>
<p class="par">Finally, in 1840, a commercial school has been
established, which is held in the rooms of the tribunal [of commerce].
Bookkeeping, commercial correspondence, and the living languages are
taught there free of charge. By a choice quite extraordinary, a marked
preference is given to the French language, although that language is
one that is spoken the least in that part of the world; since
unfortunately our relations there are very few, as we have no longer
any need to go there after sugar.</p>
<p class="par">Very well equipped libraries exist in all the convents,
and those of the university and of the colleges offer resources to the
students who receive their education in those establishments.</p>
<p class="par">This is all we have to say in regard to the institutions
consecrated to the education of the young men. That of the young women
has not been forgotten. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb268" href=
"#pb268" name="pb268">268</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The seminary of Santa Potenciana was founded in the year
1589 by Governor Dasmari&ntilde;as, by virtue of a royal order. Article
27 of that ordinance contains the following: &ldquo;Upon arriving at
the Filipinas Islands you shall ascertain how and where, and with what
endowment, a convent for the shelter of girls may be founded, so that
both those who should come from here and those born there may live in
it and so that they may live modestly, and after being well instructed,
may go out therefrom to be married and bear children.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3872src" href="#xd21e3872" name="xd21e3872src">2</a>
The worthy governor was so zealous in carrying out the wishes of the
king that, in the year 1593, the convent was established in the church
of San Andres. A new royal ordinance of June 11, 1594 approved the
regulations of it, which bore on the conduct to be observed in the
parlor, on the duties of the chaplain, who was to be more than forty
years old, and who was to be, at the same time, the manager of the
house, on the customs of both pupils and the superior and mistress. It
was to be suitable, but modest. The king took charge of the furnishing
thereof. The governor was authorized to fix the sum which was to be
paid by the women who desired to enter the convent in order to be
cloistered there. That sum was to be very moderate.</p>
<p class="par">There exists no longer any copy of the first rule of
that house, whose archives perished in the terrible earthquake of 1645,
when ten or twelve pupils lost their lives. New rules were drawn up and
approved in 1696, and remained in force until 1823, at which time they
were revised.</p>
<p class="par">The school is established at present in a house which
was bought for its use by the public treasury, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb269" href="#pb269" name=
"pb269">269</a>]</span>namely, the ancient locality of the arsenal. The
treasurer also furnishes the expenses of a small chapel, those of their
medical service, of pharmacy, of the infirmary, of the clothing of the
pupils, and of six serving girls, the total sum amounting to 700
piastres per year, besides the support of a sacristan, four
fagot-gatherers, and one woman to go for provisions. The treasury pays
for the support of one superior, of one portress, and twenty-four
collegiates, 1&frac12; reals (one franc) per day for each one. And they
are given besides, from the royal magazines, 46 baskets of
<i>pinagua</i> rice, of 15 gantas per basket, 25 quintals of wood, and
17 gantas of cocoanut oil for lights.</p>
<p class="par">After the foundation of the confraternity of the Santa
Misericordia, the latter also supported many poor Spanish orphan girls.
It caused those girls to be reared either at Santa Potenciana or in
private houses. But in 1632, a house having been bought in order to
gather them all there together, the confraternity founded the school of
Santa Isabel. The rules drawn up in 1650 were entirely changed in 1813.
The number of the pupils in this institution is at present 105, who are
admitted under divers titles and conditions. The boarders pay 60
piastres annually. The others get their education free. Day pupils are
also admitted there, but they are not allowed to communicate with those
who live in the house. The teaching is quite elementary. The service is
furnished by twelve servant girls for the interior, and eight men for
the outside work.</p>
<p class="par">In the preceding chapters, the description of the
<i lang="es">beaterios</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e3891src" href=
"#xd21e3891" name="xd21e3891src">3</a> has been seen, of which the
majority are dedicated to the education of poor young girls.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb270" href="#pb270" name=
"pb270">270</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">One can see, after what we have just said, that
education in the Philippines, both of the children of the country and
of the mestizos and Indians of both sexes, is not so greatly neglected
as certain persons pretend, and that the colony has made, on the
contrary, from the earliest times the greatest efforts for the
instruction of the people. Even in the smallest villages the Indians
find facilities for learning to read and write. For everywhere one
finds primary schools which are supported by the people. On the other
hand, the aptness of the Indians is quite remarkable. From the most
tender age they can be seen trying to draw their letters with a
sharpened bamboo either on the sand or on the green banana leaves. Also
many excellent copyists can be found among them, who are skilful in
imitating any kind of writing, designs, or printed characters. Among
others, there is mentioned a missal book which was copied by an Indian
and sent to one of the Spanish kings. It is asserted that it was
impossible to distinguish it from the original. They also copy
geographical maps with rare exactness.</p>
<p class="par">It follows, then, that the instruction of the Indians is
far from being backward, if one compares it with that of the popular
classes in Europe. Nearly all the Tag&aacute;logs know how to read and
write. However, in regard to the sciences, properly so called, very
little progress has been made in them among the Indians of the
Philippines. Some mestizos alone have a slight smattering of them, and
those among the Indians who have received orders know Latin. The most
erudite are without doubt those who, having studied at the university
of Santo Tom&aacute;s, have embraced the career of the bar. Among them
are <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb271" href="#pb271" name=
"pb271">271</a>]</span>counted advocates worthy of being placed by the
side of the most celebrated in Spain.</p>
<p class="par">In regard to what concerns literature, there is a
Tag&aacute;log grammar and dictionary, as well as a work called
<i>arte</i>, which is a kind of polyglot grammar, of the
Tag&aacute;log, Bicol, Visayan and Isinayan. All these works, and in
general everything that appears in one of the languages of the country,
are published by the care of the religious, who have at their
disposition the printing house of Santo Tom&aacute;s, and who have the
means of meeting the expenses of the printing, which the Indians could
not do. Both at Manila and in its environs there are several printing
houses for the use of the public. They are the presses of Nuestra
Se&ntilde;ora de Loreto at Sampaloc, which issues grammars,
dictionaries, works of history, etc. There was formerly published at
Manila a newspaper called <i lang="es">El noticioso Filipino</i>. Today
it appears there only as [a paper of] the prices current in Spanish and
in English. At our departure the establishment of a new newspaper was
beginning.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3909src" href="#xd21e3909" name=
"xd21e3909src">4</a></p>
<p class="par">The literary works consist of pieces in verse, sometimes
on very weighty subjects. Thus, for example, the &ldquo;Passion of our
Lord&rdquo; has been translated into Tag&aacute;log verse. Then there
are tragedies, which as we have mentioned above are excessively
long.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3923src" href="#xd21e3923" name=
"xd21e3923src">5</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb272" href="#pb272"
name="pb272">272</a>]</span>They often contain the entire life of a
king. There are, furthermore, little poems, <i>corridas</i>,
epithaliums, and songs. These last especially are very numerous and
have special names, such as <i lang="es">comintang de la conquista</i>,
the <i>sinanpablo</i>, the <i>batangui&ntilde;o</i>, the
<i>cavitegan</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3951src" href="#xd21e3951"
name="xd21e3951src">6</a> Not only are the words of these songs, but
also the melodies, national, and the Indians note the music of them
with prodigious cleverness. All the Indians, in fact, are naturally
given to music and there are some of them who play five or six
instruments. Also there is not a village, however small it be, where
mass is not accompanied by music for lack of an organ. The choice of
the airs which they play is not always the most edifying. We have heard
in the churches the waltzes of Musard, and the gayest airs of the
French comic opera.</p>
<p class="par">Thus, as we have just said, the Indians are born
musicians. Those who before knew only the Chinese tam-tam, the Javanese
drum, and a kind of flute of Pan, made of a bit of bamboo, today
cultivate the European instruments with a love which comes to be a
passion. They are not, for the most part, very strong in vocal music,
for they have very little or no voice. Nevertheless, their singing
offers in our opinion a certain character of originality which is not
unworthy of attention.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3963src" href=
"#xd21e3963" name="xd21e3963src">7</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb273" href="#pb273" name="pb273">273</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Scarcely had the Spaniards conquered that archipelago
than its inhabitants tried to imitate the musical instruments of
Europe, and the <i>viguela</i>, a kind of guitar having a very great
number of strings, but which is not always the same, soon became their
favorite instrument. They manufactured it with a remarkable perfection.
And besides, they themselves made the strings.</p>
<p class="par">The <i>bandolon</i> is another guitar, but smaller;
having twenty-four metallic strings joined by fours. They are very
skilful in playing that instrument, and they make use either of one of
their finger nails, which they allow to grow to a very great length, or
of a little bit of wood. We do not know from what nation they have
borrowed that instrument, which we have never seen in Spain.</p>
<p class="par">The music of the villages of which we have spoken is
generally composed of violins, of ebony flutes, or even of bamboo in
the remote provinces, and of a <i lang="es">bajo de viguela</i>, a
large guitar of the size of a violon-cello, which is played with a horn
or ebony finger expressly made [for that purpose]. They draw from it
very agreeable sounds. That music, somewhat discordant, is not often
wholly without something agreeable in it. We cannot help admiring men
who can reach that point without having taken lessons, and of whom the
majority have perhaps never had occasion to meet an artist.</p>
<p class="par">The military music of the regiments of the garrison at
Manila, and in some large villages of the provinces, has reached a
point of perfection which is astonishing. We have never heard better in
Spain, not even in Madrid. It is at the square of the palace that, on
Thursdays, Sundays, and f&ecirc;te days, at eight <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb274" href="#pb274" name=
"pb274">274</a>]</span>o&rsquo;clock in the evening, at the time when
the retreat is beaten, the society of Manila and the foreigners and
travelers, assemble to hear the concert. The Indians play there from
memory for two or three hours alternately, from great overtures of
Rossini and Meyerbeer, or contradances, and vaudevilles. They owe the
great progress which they have made for some time in their military
music to the French masters who direct them. These same musicians are
also summoned to the great balls, where they execute pieces among the
contradances played by other instruments.</p>
<p class="par">We have stated that the vocal music of the Indians is
not equal to that of their instrumental music, which is especially true
of the quality of their voice, which is sharp and shrill. All their
airs are applied to words of love; they are regrets, and reproaches,
addressed to a faithless swain, and sometimes allusions drawn from the
history of the ancient kings, or from holy Scripture.</p>
<p class="par">Sometimes a number of Indians gather in the house of one
of them and form a concert of amateurs. At that time they sing the
Passion to the accompaniment of a full orchestra. At other times five,
seven, or nine <i>bagontaos</i> (young bachelors) assemble at night in
the beautiful clear moonlight and run about the villages in the
vicinity of Manila, where they give serenades to their sweethearts,
their <i>dalagas</i>, or <i>donzellias</i> [<i>i.e.</i>,
<i>doncella</i> (maidens)], whom the Tag&aacute;logs who are of more
distinguished rank and who speak Spanish call their <i lang=
"es">novias</i> [<i>i.e.</i>, sweethearts]. One could imagine nothing
more singular and more picturesque than to see during those brilliant
nights of the torrid zone, when the moon sheds floods of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb275" href="#pb275" name=
"pb275">275</a>]</span>silver light, and the balmy breeze tempers the
burning heat of the atmosphere, to see, we say, the Indians crouched
<i lang="es">en cuclillas</i> for entire hours without getting tired of
that position, which we would find so uncomfortable, singing their love
under the windows of their mistresses.</p>
<p class="par">Numerous orchestras of musicians are summoned at any
hour of the day to the houses of Manila in order to have all sorts of
ancient and modern dances there: the old rigodons,<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e4023src" href="#xd21e4023" name="xd21e4023src">8</a>
quadrilles, the English contradances, waltzes, gallops, and without
doubt the polka will not be long in penetrating there also. It is rare
among the Indians, and especially among the mestizos, that a baptism,
marriage, or any ceremony is celebrated without music and dancing. The
burial of children (<i lang="es">criaturas</i>) is always accompanied
by music.</p>
<p class="par">One further word on the extraordinary talent of the
Indians for musical execution. One day we accompanied Monsieur Auguste
Barrot, our worthy consul, the alcalde of the province of Laguna, on a
tour which he was making for the election of gobernadorcillos. We
reached Cala&uuml;an, where we stopped to sup and sleep at the house of
a respectable cura whose house, like that of all ecclesiastics, was
open to all travelers without exception. Travelers are there fed and
lodged as long as they please to stop and without any cost to them.
Now, at the house of this cura we heard an Indian who played with equal
perfection on seven different instruments, on which he executed the
most difficult pieces. When he had finished, the good cura, in order to
amuse us, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb276" href="#pb276" name=
"pb276">276</a>]</span>performed some sleight of hand tricks and
juggling, and showed us a theater of marionnettes, which he had himself
mounted.</p>
<p class="par">The <i>comintang</i>, which we have before mentioned as
a national song, is also a dance. While the musicians are playing and
singing it an Indian and an Indian woman execute a pantomime which
agrees with the words. It is a lover who is trying to inflame the heart
of a young girl, about whom he runs while making innumerable amorous
movements and greetings in the fashion of the country, accompanied by
movements of the arms and of the body, which are not the most decent,
but which cause the spectators to break out into loud and joyous
laughter. Finally, the lover, not being able to succeed, feigns to be
sick and falls into a chair prepared for him. The young girl,
frightened, flies to his aid but he rises again very soon cured, and
begins to dance and turn about with her in all directions, to the great
applause of those present.</p>
<p class="par">The <i>pampamgo</i> is another dance which is especially
remarkable by the movements of the loins, and the special grace which
the women show in it. It is accompanied by very significative clapping
of the hands.</p>
<p class="par">In the Visayas they dance the <i>bagay</i>, the music
and song of which are langorous and melancholy, like that of the
comintang. It is also a lover and a mistress who dance, the while they
mingle their motions with cries.</p>
<p class="par">The Montescos of the provinces of the north of the
island of Lu&ccedil;on also dance to the sound of their bamboo flutes,
but their gestures and their postures are so indecent that for shame a
woman never dances except with her husband. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb277" href="#pb277" name="pb277">277</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The Negritos in their dances hold in their hands their
bow and arrows and utter horrible cries. They make frightful
contortions and leaps to which in the country one has given the name of
<i>camarones</i>, comparing them to those that the sea-crabs make in
the water. They end their dance by shooting their arrows into the air,
and their eyesight is so quick that they sometimes kill a bird on the
wing. Their <i>ouroucay</i>, or song of the mountains, is a very
pleasing melody consisting of six measures which are repeated time and
time again, which if it were arranged for chorus, would make a fine
effect.</p>
<p class="par">The <i>fandango</i>, the <i>&ccedil;apateado</i>, the
<i>cachucha</i>, and other Spanish dances have been adopted by the
Indians, and they do not lack grace when they dance them to the
accompaniment of castinets, which they play with a remarkable
precision. They also execute some dances of Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, such
as for example the <i>jarab&egrave;s</i>, where they show all the
Spanish vivacity with movements of their figure, of their breasts, of
their hips, to right and left forward and backward, and pirouettes,
whose rapidity is such that the eye can scarce follow them.</p>
<p class="par">Drawing and painting are much further advanced than one
would believe among the Indians of the Philippines. Without taking into
account the fine geographical maps of Nicolas de Ocampo, we can cite
the miniatures of Denian, and Sauriano, the pictures of churches, and
the oil portraits of Oreco. Those works are indeed far from being
perfect, for the artists to whom they are due have never had any
masters, but they present marks of great talent, and the portraits have
a striking resemblance [to the original]. We seize this occasion to
testify all our <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb278" href="#pb278"
name="pb278">278</a>]</span>gratitude to the two mestizo designers,
Juan Serapio Transfiguracion Nepomuceno, and his son, for the services
which as artists they have been pleased to render us with so much
kindness. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb279" href="#pb279" name=

pupils under the auspices of the municipality and the protection of the
captain-general, then Fernando Norzagaray. By January 2 of the
following year the pupils numbered 124. All the elementary primary
studies were taught, as well as most of those of secondary instruction,
and superior education, in accordance with the regulations then in
force. In 1865 it was declared a college of secondary instruction under
the title of &ldquo;Ateneo Municipal [<i>i.e.</i>, Municipal Athenaeum]
of Manila,&rdquo; by the Madrid government. Some years later it had 200
boarding pupils and a large number of day pupils, and it was impossible

<p class="par">There were also classes in drawing, vocal and

graduated, the per cent of those graduates studying agriculture being
the lowest. In that period 173 A. B. degrees, 40 titles of commercial
expert, and 19 titles of agricultural expert had been conferred. The

belonged to the department of primary instruction, 514 to the general
studies of secondary instruction, and 152 to the studies of

<p class="par first"><i>University of Manila. Naval School.</i></p>
<p class="par">The university has many enemies and some arguers who do
not oppose it because it is directed by Dominican friars, but because
they believe the study of law inadvisable. This opinion is anti-liberal
and does not merit refutation. Even if it did merit it, the moment
would never be opportune for a democratic revolution, which even runs
the danger of going too far in its generalizations, as we have already
stated. The greater convenience of a school of medicine and surgery,
professions in which the Indians would probably give better results
than in the forum, might be maintained. But since true progress does
not consist in destroying, but in reforming and improving gradually, we
are inclined as the generality of those who have been in Filipinas, to
the realization of the secularization which is demanded in regard to
superior public instruction, and which appears to be the desire of the
government at this time, by means of the establishment <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb287" href="#pb287" name="pb287">287</a>]</span>in
the university itself of that school, to which the Dominican fathers,
who have made the greatest sacrifices for their country, would not
hesitate to offer themselves. And even if the study of pharmacy were
added to it, it would also be convenient. That science must adjust
itself to the conditions of the Indian, and there is an unquestioned
need for it there; for, although its principal subdivisions have been
studied by some religious, such as botany, mineral waters, etc., there
is still much to do. It is the general opinion that the Philippine
fields with their innumerable and unknown herbs offer remedies for all
diseases, but the science is given up to chicanery, and the empiricism
of the <i lang="es">mediquillos</i>. The Indians accept Spanish
medicines under no consideration. Therefore, it is necessary to
regenerate the class of the former by prohibiting intrusions into the
field of the profession, and by obliging them to study it from its
beginnings in the university of Manila under Spanish professors, who
ought to be those of military health [<i lang="es">Sanidad
militar</i>]&mdash;men who acquire great skill in the hospitals and
come to be specialists in the diseases of the country. The suppression
of some obstacles which still exist in regard to the admission of
foreign professors will also be an excellent measure. In regard to
pharmacy, of which there exist no regular establishments outside of
Manila, Cavite, Ceb&uacute;, and, I believe, Cagay&aacute;n, great
rigor must be exercised in removing from it abuses and ignorance which
give place to the most grave consequences. As there exists no
authoritative personnel, wandering peddlers easily obtain a permit from
the superior government to add to their work the sale of drugs. At
times they are subjected <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb288" href=
"#pb288" name="pb288">288</a>]</span>to light examinations by the
subdelegate. The consequence is that the provinces are swamped with
counterfeit and dangerous products when they are not objects of
perfumery, which the poor natives swallow as chemical products. In
Pampanga we have seen a preparation of lettuce or of some similar
vegetable sold as a tailor&rsquo;s chalk [<i lang="es">jaboncillo de
sastre</i>], which was of more use for washing the hands than for
modifying the nervous contractions of the muscles.</p>
<p class="par">Hence, the intrusions of the mediquillo and of the
<i lang="es">matand&aacute;</i> (the old man) who with true
enchantments and superstitious remedies cures the poor sick people,
cannot be combated with efficacy. In Batangas dead flies that were
killed by the fresh paint of a saint have been prescribed, and brick
dust where the mark of a foot had appeared to the native curas as a
miraculous thing imprinted by the Virgin who was coming to adore a
cross near by. The pills of Holloway and the products of foreign
charlatanism reap their harvest.</p>
<p class="par">Hence also, the poor parish priests have to serve as
physicians and apothecaries in extreme cases. Very frequently the
mediquillo when he sees that it is a case of exhaustion, absconds or
disappears, and then what can a poor friar do at the bedside of a sick
person who dies without human aid? Consequently, the literature of the
convents has produced many [medical] works, some of them of merit,
destined to be used as a <i>vade mecum</i> in these ordinary cases.
Even notions of obstetrics (the science of childbirth) are given in
some of those books, since there are theologues who counsel proceeding
to the most risky operations in order to be able to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb289" href="#pb289" name=
"pb289">289</a>]</span>baptize the fetus. In the <i lang=
"es">Embriologia</i> [<i>i.e.</i>, <i>Embriology</i>] of Father
Sanz,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4260src" href="#xd21e4260" name=
"xd21e4260src">2</a> one reads of cases truly inconceivable, and in the
<i lang="es">Ilustracion filipina</i>,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4269src" href="#xd21e4269" name="xd21e4269src">3</a> a periodical
which was published in our time, appeared articles in regard to the
mediquillos and midwives, which by themselves alone would authorize a
reform of those professions so interesting to humanity. In difficult
childbirth it is very common for the operator to press down on the
abdomen of the sick woman, and to have recourse to other proceedings
similar to it. The first month after birth the Indian children pass in
a perpetual martyrdom, for they are rubbed hourly with very hot
cocoanut oil, a custom doubtless preserved from the woods, where in
their savage state they make of the children a flexible serpent which
escapes from the hand.</p>
<p class="par">Since surgery, in spite of being an almost useless
science in Filipinas, where the great agricultural and industrial works
which cause mutilations and accidents do not exist, for the Indian when
he works never does it with the enthusiasm and abnegation which we see
in Europa, but very tranquilly and carefully looking out beforehand to
what he exposes himself&mdash;surgery, we repeat, properly so
called&mdash;does not exist where there are no Spanish operators. For
the bite of a monkey, which would disappear in a fortnight by
cauterization, we have seen so many plasters applied and so many waters
from miraculous springs (among them a bandage soaked in holy water)
that they have very likely killed the sick person, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb290" href="#pb290" name=
"pb290">290</a>]</span>since he had suffered two long years when we
left the province. If the oils and balsams from those oleaginous plants
(and among them there are some truly wonderful) produced no effect, the
mediquillo, losing his bearings, soon has recourse to the charms and
devilments which bring a sick one to the grave.</p>
<p class="par">There is another educational institution in Manila which
is susceptible of great development and of producing vast advantages
for the country, namely, the naval school. Poorly organized and almost
always worse directed, it only graduates pupils with great pretentious,
who aspire from the first moment to posts in the warships, where they
are quickly confounded with the very least predicaments. If this
institution on the other hand were well organized as a school of
pilots, it could supply useful men to the great number of boats engaged
in the coasting trade. The native sailor is bold even to folly in the
ordinary accidents of navigation, but timorous and irresolute in
exigencies, and absolutely lacks means to escape from them. Hence they
go with the greatest impassiveness through those labyrinths of hidden
rocks and reefs, which fill the sea of Mindoro and the Calamianes in
pancos and paraos which scarcely can be used for the navigation of
rivers and creeks. But at the first puff of a strong wind, which,
although it does not break it, tears the helm from their hands at the
first movement of that stormy sea where cataclysms are more frequent
than ashore, the poor <i lang="es">arraez</i> [<i>i.e.</i>, master] as
the captain there is still called, harassed and disturbed, either
kneels down with all his crew to invoke God, placing on the helm his
<i lang="tl">antin-antin</i> (amulet, a kind of scapulary which no
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb291" href="#pb291" name=
"pb291">291</a>]</span>Indian is without during these voyages, and
which has more of paganism than Christianity), or takes refuge in the
hatchway in order not to behold the dangers that he is running. If any
Spaniard is in the boat, the command is assuredly given to him,
although he understands less of sea-affairs than the said captain. That
has happened more than once to all of us who have traveled much from
one island to another, and surely not even in boats of a certain
importance, almost brigantines, when the master is a Tag&aacute;log,
have we ever met with sea-compass, barometer, or glass, or any other of
the instruments most indispensable for navigation.</p>
<p class="par">This is enough to prove the importance which ought to be
given to the naval school, whose organization must be very imperfect,
since even yet its results are almost nil. It depends provisionally on
the superior civil government, a circumstance which appears absurd to
us. Like this there exist many things which we have neither time nor
scientific capacity to unfold. It belongs to the government to do now
what is proposed, namely, reform the public instruction of
Filipinas.</p>

<h3 class="main">SCHOOLS OF PRIMARY LETTERS</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The primary school, the most interesting among all
peoples, and more yet among backward peoples, was found in our time in
an incipient condition, if one considers it as the government desires
it, and as a great number of royal decrees resolved. Primary
instruction in Castilian was alone known in Manila and some suburbs of
the capital, but in the dialects of the country there existed
boys&rsquo; schools in all the villages, and in the majority of them,
also schools <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb292" href="#pb292" name=
"pb292">292</a>]</span>for girls. It is a fact that such schools did
not count on more elements than the pay assigned by the government for
the teachers,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4301src" href="#xd21e4301"
name="xd21e4301src">4</a> and the parish priests together with the
provincial chiefs had to decide on the means for the construction and
conservation of the edifices and furnishings, the former paying in
addition their salaries to the teachers of the girls, or paying them
from the funds of the churches according to the wealth of each one.</p>
<p class="par">This system gave the consequent result of there not
being any suitable directors for complete primary instruction. But in
reading, writing, and religion, in the majority of the villages of the
archipelago, there was found a greater number proportionally than in
Espa&ntilde;a, for the missionaries always <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb293" href="#pb293" name=
"pb293">293</a>]</span>considered that education as the first element
of civilization and adhesion of those inhabitants to the crown of
Castilla.</p>
<p class="par">The government tried to improve and make general that
education, but in the Spanish language.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4316src" href="#xd21e4316" name="xd21e4316src">5</a> For that
purpose the assembly appointed in 1861 made some regulations, taking as
its base the creation of a normal school, which has had realization,
and according to Se&ntilde;or Barrantes, in the above-cited work, it
seems that instruction has improved somewhat in what relates to the
Spanish.</p>
<p class="par">The question of whether the parish priests or
missionaries have opposed those rules is of little importance to us. As
in all disputable cases there are partisans who favor and those who
oppose&mdash;not the advantage which the generalization of the Spanish
language might be, for all people recognize and admit this hypothesis,
but only the results which the generalization of the Spanish language
would produce, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb294" href="#pb294" name=
"pb294">294</a>]</span>reckoning on the slight capacity of the natives
to utilize the good that they might read in the idiom of Cervantes, and
bearing in mind the political make-up of that country and the evil
effects which would be produced by the daily publications which would
arrive [from Espa&ntilde;a], and which are incapable of enlightening
the little but submissive intelligence of those inhabitants, yet always
sufficient to excite the passions of men who would easily confuse
rights with individual duties, giving a worse result than that which
the history of our ancient colonies registers.</p>
<p class="par">As we do not know of this department in the present
circumstances more than that which the above-cited work brings to
light, we shall limit ourselves to calling the attention of the
government so that it may introduce in that department all the
improvements possible, extending the normal school, which gives very
slight results for a people of five millions, and proving whether this
normal school, organized with a mixture of the language of the country

provinces belonging to the same language, would give a more positive
result in regard to instruction, and one even more efficacious for the
propagation of the Spanish by printing works in two columns in the two

give instruction in the primary schools. Industrial teachers,
professorships for foremen and assistants for public works and master

exist in all the villages. The teacher is paid by the government, and
usually receives two dollars [<i>i.e.</i>, pesos] per month without
either lodging or board. In large villages, the pay is as high as three
and one-half dollars, but he must pay an assistant out of that. The
schools are under the supervision of the parish priests. Reading and
writing are taught, the instruction being in Spanish. The teacher is
properly required to teach his scholars Spanish, but he himself does
not know it. On the other hand, the Spanish officials do not understand
the native languages. The priests, moreover, have no inclination to
alter these conditions, which are very useful for their influence.
Almost the only Indians who know Spanish are those who have been in the
service of Europeans. A sort of devotional primer is read in the native
speech (Bicol) at first, and later the Christian doctrine. The reading
book is called Casayayan. On an average, half of the children attend
school, usually from the seventh to the tenth year. They learn to read
somewhat, and some learn also a little of writing, but they forget it
soon. Only those who later enter service as clerks write easily, and
most of them have a good hand. Some pastors do not allow boys and girls
to attend the same school, in which case they also pay a special
schoolmistress at the rate of one dollar per month. The Indians learn
to reckon with great difficulty. They generally rake shells or stones
to help them, which they heap up and then count. See Jagor&rsquo;s

&ldquo;The Spanish government was really anxious that all Filipinos
should speak the Spanish language, as it is understood that the use of
a common language is the manner of forming a national spirit and
sentiment, the only thing that can preserve and unite in constant
friendship people of different races. Nevertheless, the monastic orders
were always decidedly opposed to the Spanish language being spoken in
Philippine territory, because their interests would have been greatly
injured if such language had become general throughout the archipelago,
as from that time they would have ceased to be the intermediaries
between the people and the authorities and would no longer be required
by either, which would reduce their great influence with both
parties.... As a consequence of all this the Spanish language did not
become general, and due to the diversity of dialects in the country and
the lack of books in these dialects, education went along a hard and
difficult path. Some officials of the Spanish government assisted the
friars in this work.&rdquo; See Tom&aacute;s del Rosario&rsquo;s
article in <i>Census of Philippines</i>, iii, p. 594. For the friar
side of this question, see the statements of Fathers Navarro and
Zamora, which will appear in the appendix to our <span class="sc">VOL.

<h2 class="main">PUBLIC INSTRUCTION</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Public instruction is sufficiently far advanced in
Filipinas, especially in what refers to primary instruction.</p>
<p class="par">It is strange to see that in the most remote villages,
the majority of the Indians know how to read and even to write, having
learned without teachers, and solely through the strength of their
inclination and extraordinary patience.</p>
<p class="par">The public schools are better organized today, and have
in charge of them teachers who have graduated from the normal school of
Manila. It cannot fail to be worthy of striking the attention that
almost all the boys and girls who attend the schools read Spanish
without understanding it, and write our language by drawing the letters
materially.</p>
<p class="par">Secondary education is studied in the college of San
Juan de Letr&aacute;n, created into an institute in 1820, in that of
Santo Tom&aacute;s, in charge of the Dominican fathers; in the Ateneo
Municipal, under the direction of the Jesuits; in the college of San
Jos&eacute;, directed by the secular clergy; and in various private
schools.</p>
<p class="par">Superior branches are studied in the royal and
pontifical university of Santo Tom&aacute;s, of Manila, founded at the
beginning of the seventeenth century. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb297" href="#pb297" name="pb297">297</a>]</span>It was erected under
the name of College of Santo Tom&aacute;s de Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de
Rosario of Manila, August 15, 1619. Felipe IV approved it by a decree
of November 27, 1623. Pope Innocent X conceded to this college on
November 20, 1645, the title of university, and Clement XII extended
its studies to civil and canonical law, and the other subjects that are
studied in universities.</p>
<p class="par">It is pontifical, for the degrees which are conferred in
it have canonical effect and supply ecclesiastics for determined
charges, according to the bulls of Innocent X and Clement XII.</p>
<p class="par">It is in charge of the illustrious Dominican fathers,
its founders, who fill the greater number of its chairs.</p>
<p class="par">With reference to the reform introduced by royal order
of October 29, 1875, the studies necessary for the professions or
jurisprudence and of the Church, and of medicine, pharmacy, and notary,
are given in this institution.</p>
<p class="par">Manila has a seminary, called San Carlos, and the same
is true of Ceb&uacute; and Ilo&iacute;lo.</p>
<p class="par">The seminary in Camarines Sur is called Nuestra
Se&ntilde;ora del Rosario, and that of Ilocos Sur is entitled Nuestra
Se&ntilde;ora de la Concepci&oacute;n.</p>
<p class="par">Furthermore, there is a naval academy in Manila, another
of drawing and painting, a normal school for men teachers, chairs of
bookkeeping, languages, and history, and a meteorological
observatory.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4370src" href="#xd21e4370"
name="xd21e4370src">1</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb298" href=
"#pb298" name="pb298">298</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The naval school was established in 1862, at the
instance of the consulado of commerce. In it are taught arithmetic,
elementary geometry, plane and spherical trigonometry, cosmography,
pilotage, practical geometry applied to the construction of
hydrographic maps and plans, and methods of drawing them, etc.,
etc.</p>
<p class="par">The academy of drawing and painting was instituted by
the Hoard of Trade, March 1, 1849. Its classes consist of figure
drawing, ornamentation, and modeling, both in nature and in colors.</p>
<p class="par">The normal school for the training of men teachers of
primary instruction was created by royal decree of December 20, 1863,
and was inaugurated January 23, 1865, under the direction of the
fathers of the Society of Jesus.</p>
<p class="par">For young women, Manila has the beaterio of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb299" href="#pb299" name=
"pb299">299</a>]</span>Santa Catalina de Sena, instituted in 1696 for
the general instruction of girls, and ruled over by a prioress chosen
by the mothers; the beaterio-college of Santa Rita, created in 1740,
for the education of Indian orphan girls; that of Santa Rosa, founded
in 1750, for the purpose of educating poor girls; the college of La
Concordia; that of Santa Isabel; and the municipal school for girls,
directed by the sisters of charity.</p>

meteorological observatory was founded by the Jesuits in 1865, its main
object being the discovery of the laws of the typhoons that rage in
Oriental seas. Its other departments&mdash;seismatic, magnetic and
astronomic&mdash;were added later. For the first five years the
apparatus was very scarce, and most of that was lent by the Ateneo
Municipal, but notwithstanding that, some excellent work was done in
those early years. In 1870, the publication of a bulletin was begun,
and new apparatus began to be installed. The first typhoon was forecast
and notice of its coming given in 1879. Finally the government
authorities made the observatory a central institution and placed it
officially in charge of the Jesuits. In 1898, through the influence of
the British meteorologist at Hongkong, the United States government
ordered the coming of typhoons not to be announced, but the order was
speedily revoked. Of this observatory Packard says in the Educational
Report for 1897&ndash;98, pp. 973, 974: &ldquo;The latest fruit of the
scientific activity of the Jesuits, and the most important and best
known scientific institution in the Philippines, and perhaps in the
whole east, is the famous meteorological observatory of Manila, which
was founded in 1865, and now has one of the most complete equipments
for meteorological observations in the world. An important practical
service which the observatory renders shipping is the warning of
approaching hurricanes, which it is enabled to give by means of its
branch stations at different points in several of the islands. The
Jesuit father Faura, who is so well known for his meteorological work,
has been for a long time in charge of the observatory, and began
forecasting the weather as early as 1879. Expeditions have been made
under his direction all over the archipelago, with a view to making
magnetic and other observations.&rdquo; See also <i lang=

thanks to the excessive tolerance of their professors, and once
converted into licentiates and even doctors, they pay for their
benefits and the honor which they have received by becoming outrageous
anti-Spanish. They believe themselves superior to the latter, and dream
of republics in which they can figure and strut. Their ridiculous
hopes, and their vanity and deficiency would be excusable, if they did
not deceive their simple countrymen in a nursery of litigation with
their eagerness of defending evil causes. Such is, although it be a
cause for regret, the general rule. See Montero y Vidal, <i lang=

one of the needs that has been most apparent to the American

various forms of engineering. Regarding trade schools and industrial

<h2 class="main">GIRLS&rsquo; SCHOOLS IN MANILA AND THE PROVINCES</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">There are four colleges for the education of girls
without taking into consideration the municipal school of
Manila,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4708src" href="#xd21e4708" name=
"xd21e4708src">1</a> and the college of Santa Isabel, of Nueva
C&aacute;ceres.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4714src" href="#xd21e4714"
name="xd21e4714src">2</a> These are the college of Santa Isabel, that
of Santa Rosa, that of Santa Catalina, and that of La Concordia, also
called college of the Immaculate Conception, all located in the capital
of the archipelago. Of all these institutions, the oldest is the
college of Santa Isabel, founded in 1632 for the education of Spanish
orphan girls by a pious foundation called the Santa Misericordia. In
1650, the first regulations for the government of the same were issued,
which continued in force until 1813, when they were revised. The
college is supported from part of the interest derived from the
Misericordia legacy, administered by a board, of which the civil
governor of Manila is the president. It also enjoys a grant of land in
Tagud&iacute;n, province of Pangasin&aacute;n, by a royal cedula of
March 14, 1680, which produces an income of 600 pesos per annum.</p>
<p class="par">Until the beginning of the present century, nearly
13,060 girls had been educated in this institution. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb305" href="#pb305" name="pb305">305</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">In 1861, the governor-general of the archipelago added
the royal college of Santa Potenciana to the college of Santa
Isabel.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4725src" href="#xd21e4725" name=
"xd21e4725src">3</a> The former was composed of the orphan daughters of
military men, and was a most ancient and beneficent institution,
founded about the end of the sixteenth century by Perez
Dasmari&ntilde;as. It afforded shelter and protection to the orphan
daughters of military men who had succumbed to the climatological
influences of this country, or had died in the defense of their
country.</p>
<p class="par">The colleges were under the protection of private ladies
and afforded quite sufficient instruction. In 1863, the sisters of
charity assumed charge of the same, to the great advantage of the
college and of the morality of the pupils.</p>
<p class="par">In 1879, the college underwent a considerable
reformation by order of Governor-general Moriones, who gave the college
a new set of regulations and opened its doors to day pupils and
half-boarders, and in 1880 the board of directors established new
chairs, which make this establishment one of the most complete for the
education of European young ladies.</p>
<p class="par">Girls admitted are given a dowry of 500 pesos, but under
the condition that they must first secure the title of teacher, without
which requisite, even though they get married, they are given nothing.
When they have concluded their studies, they engage in work, and the
college reserves to them one-half <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb306"
href="#pb306" name="pb306">306</a>]</span>of what they earn, which is
added to their dowry.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4739src" href=
"#xd21e4739" name="xd21e4739src">4</a></p>
<p class="par"><i>Retreat and college of Santa Catalina</i></p>
<p class="par">The college of Santa Catalina follows next in order of
antiquity to the college of Santa Isabel. It was founded in 1696 by the
provincial, then belonging to the Dominican order, the very reverend
father, Juan de Santo Domingo.</p>
<p class="par">There were purchased for the purposes of the college, at
the account of the province of Sant&iacute;simo Rosario, some houses
adjoining the convent of Santo Domingo, to serve as an asylum to the
young ladies who desire to consecrate therein their virginity to the
Lord.</p>
<p class="par">The institution was inaugurated on the day of St. Ann,
of the year mentioned, after the approval of the rules to be observed,
in conformity with the spirit and statutes of the Tertiary Order of St.
Dominic, with some modifications for the proper interior r&eacute;gime,
based upon the principal laws and ordinations of the province of
Sant&iacute;simo Rosario. On this day some ladies who had long before
adopted the dress of the Tertiary order, took the vows, binding
themselves to the strictest observance of the new rule, and taking the
three religious vows with all the necessary formalities.</p>
<p class="par">Among the new nuns was the sister of Mother Francisca,
who, in order to adopt the Dominican vestments, left the rectorate of
Santa Isabel.</p>
<p class="par">The new retreat was given for a patron, the seraphic
mother, Santa Catalina de Sena. It was also ordered that there should
be only fifteen choir nuns, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb307" href=
"#pb307" name="pb307">307</a>]</span>in honor of the mysteries of the
rosary, with some lay sisters to attend to the material service.</p>
<p class="par">The foundation of this retreat was approved by a royal
despatch signed February 17, 1716, which put an end to the various
petitions which had been submitted to the court against its
installation. In 1732, a new cedula granted the retreat the right to
have a church with a bell, and prescribed, at the same time, that the
inmates were not required to observe retirement by a rigid vow, but
only for the purposes of good administration.</p>
<p class="par">The practice observed is that the sisters never pass
through the inside door of the convent, which is in charge of one of
the gravest sisters, but any person can enter it with express
permission from the provincial.</p>
<p class="par">Although in the beginning, the college of Santa Catalina
was nothing but a house, to which Spanish ladies, desirous of
renouncing the vanities of the world and of devoting themselves
entirely to the service of God, retired, the Dominican order did not
long delay in assigning some of the sisters to instruction in a
college. From that time, the retreat took the character of a college,
where the pupils, at the same time that they were instructed in
reading, writing, Christian doctrine, and other work suitable to their
sex, learned to practice virtue.</p>
<p class="par">In 1865, it was deemed proper to increase the number of
sisters fixed when the retreat was established, in order to be able to
extend instruction further, and thus place the college on the same
level as the best equipped colleges of the same class in this
capital.</p>
<p class="par">The inmates of this institution are not permitted to
leave it without good cause. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb308" href=
"#pb308" name="pb308">308</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">They may be visited by their parents and other friends
and acquaintances in a reception room located near the door of the
college.</p>
<p class="par">After the earthquakes of 1880, notable improvements were
made in the material part of the building;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4777src" href="#xd21e4777" name="xd21e4777src">5</a> and at the
present time, in the departments necessary for the good service of the
college, this establishment has a spacious working-room, large
class-rooms, well-ventilated dormitories, a beautiful bathroom, and an
ample and capacious dining-hall.</p>
<p class="par">The retreat is managed by a prioress, elected every
three years by the sisters, who acts, at the same time, as the mother
superior of the college; at the head of the latter, nevertheless, there
is a directress in charge of the instruction.</p>
<p class="par">The spiritual direction of the retreat and college is in
charge of a father of the order, appointed by the corporation for the
charge of vicar.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4790src" href="#xd21e4790"
name="xd21e4790src">6</a></p>
<p class="par"><i>College of Santa Rosa</i></p>
<p class="par">This establishment was founded in 1750 by the Paulist
Mother de la Trinidad, a nun of the Tertiary Order of St. Dominic. She
arrived in Manila the preceding year, whither she had resolved to come
from the Peninsula, desirous of consecrating herself to the good of
others. Being convinced that the greatest service she could render the
public was to establish an educational institution, she immediately
took steps to carry out her holy work, and in a short time by her
ardent zeal she secured sufficient funds for the establishment of a
retreat, where she supported <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb309" href=
"#pb309" name="pb309">309</a>]</span>on charity a certain number of
native young women for the purpose of educating them in the fear of
God, in Christian doctrine, and in all exercises suitable for a woman.
This was done so that, whether they left the retreat of their own will
and married or remained therein, they would develop strong moral
principles.</p>
<p class="par">His Majesty has taken this college under his royal
protection, and the regent of the Audiencia supervises it in his name,
with the corresponding powers.</p>
<p class="par">The spiritual direction is, at the present time,
entrusted by the archbishop to the very reverend Fray Jos&eacute;
Corujedo, former provincial of the corporation of St. Augustine.</p>
<p class="par">Up to January 26, 1866, the education of the girls was
in charge of elderly ladies, of well-known education and virtue, who
acted as teachers; but, on this date, by superior order, the sisters of
charity undertook the direction of the institution, which they
discharged to the satisfaction of all.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4811src" href="#xd21e4811" name="xd21e4811src">7</a></p>
<p class="par"><i>College of La Concordia or of the Immaculate
Conception</i></p>
<p class="par">In the town of Paco, a suburb of Manila, there is a
college, which was inaugurated May 3, 1868, ordinarily called the
college of the Concordia. The entire grounds and part of the building,
which now serves as a college, were piously donated to the sisters of
charity by a charitable lady named Margarita Roxas, whose picture is
exhibited in the reception room. Five-sixths of said college have been
built since its foundation.</p>
<p class="par">This college is the exclusive property of the sisters of
charity, who act at the same time as teachers <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb310" href="#pb310" name=
"pb310">310</a>]</span>therein. It occupies a very picturesque and open
position on a beautiful plain between the towns of Paco and of Santa
Ana, and has very capacious and well-ventilated rooms.</p>
<p class="par">It is the central building of the sisters of charity of
the Philippines, and usually a priest of the congregation of the
mission, entrusted with the spiritual direction of the college, lives
therein.</p>
<p class="par">The studies and work in this college and the
distribution of classes are identical with those of other colleges.</p>
<p class="par">From the date of the foundation of the college, up to
the present year, 62 pupils have been examined for teachers, of whom 35
were classed as excellent, 17 as good, and 10 passed.<a class="noteref"

<p class="par"><i>Asylum of St. Vincent of Paul</i></p>
<p class="par">This institution is situated in Paco, a suburb of
Manila, in the barrio of Looban. The building and its grounds, belong
to Sister Asunci&oacute;n Ventura, a sister of charity, who, being
anxious for the welfare of poor girls, donated it to the congregation
of the sisters of charity, in order that said building should be used
as an asylum for the education of about 30 poor girls. The institution
was inaugurated on November 26, 1885. Pay pupils are also admitted for
the moderate fee of 6 pesos per month.</p>
<p class="par">The sisters of charity of this institution number 5.</p>

<p class="par">The pupils are taught Christian doctrine, reading,
writing, Spanish grammar, and the four rules of arithmetic. They are
also instructed in the work of their sex&mdash;sewing, embroidering,
the making of artificial flowers, and some in housework, such as
cleaning, cooking, washing clothes, etc.</p>
<p class="par"><i>College of San Jos&eacute; de Jaro</i></p>
<p class="par">On May 1, 1872, the sisters of charity opened, with the
permission of the vice-royal patron, the college of San Jos&eacute;, in
Ilo&iacute;lo, for the instruction and education of girls. In doing
this, they acceded to the wishes expressed by some good Spaniards and
some principal citizens, and supplied a want in that capital. This
college continued in existence until 1877, when it was closed on
account of the lack of funds, as it had no funds but those derived from
the fees of the pupils, who were very few toward the end.</p>
<p class="par">Fray Mariano Cortero, bishop of Jaro, availed himself of
the opportunity to call the sisters to his city, and placed the school
in their charge. A house was leased, and beside it a frame building was
constructed for school purposes, able to accommodate about 200 girls.
Up to 1881, no boarding pupils were accepted, on account of the lack of
room; but later, at the request of some families, some girls were
admitted, the number of whom gradually increased to 50&mdash;too large
a number for so small a house. This led to the necessity of enlarging
the building, which was done by raising the school roof, and making an
upper story, by which means a large and spacious room was scoured as a
dormitory for the girls, besides a beautiful chapel.</p>
<p class="par">Instruction is divided into three
classes&mdash;superior, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb312" href=
"#pb312" name="pb312">312</a>]</span>secondary, and primary. In the
lowest class, reading and Christian doctrine are taught. In the
secondary class, Christian doctrine, reading, writing, sacred history,
and arithmetic are taught. In the superior class, the reading of
printed and written matter is taught, as well as the writing of Spanish
and English characters, geography, sacred and profane history, and
arithmetic, as well as piano for those who wish. They are also
instructed in the work of their sex&mdash;sewing, embroidering,
artificial flowers, etc.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Convent of San Ignacio</i></p>
<p class="par">Its foundation dates back to the year 1699, and it was
directed by the fathers of the Society of Jesus until they were
expelled in the last century, when it passed to the charge of the
provisor of this archbishopric. Its original object seems to have been
that of educating native girls in the fear of God, and to give them
primary instruction and instruction in the work of their sex. This
retreat serves as an asylum for devout women.</p>
<p class="par">Since 1883, a school has been established in this
retreat, with three teachers. They teach reading from the first
letters, Christian doctrine, compendium of morals, sacred history,
courtesy, arithmetic, Spanish grammar to the analysis of analogy, and
in addition they have every week an explanation of the gospel, in
charge of a priest of the secular clergy.</p>
<p class="par">Needle-work is taught from the first stitches to the
finest embroidery.</p>
<p class="par">Oil painting is also done in this institution, and we
have a teacher of embroidery, who is an expert in this art, and whose
work is much applauded.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4898src"

<p class="par">[The following girls&rsquo; schools are noted also by
<i lang="es">Archipi&eacute;lago Filipino</i>, i, p. 353.]</p>
<p class="par">Schools for the education of girls, which, without
having the rank of normal schools, exist outside the capital of the
archipelago, are principally the four following, the first three of
which are in charge of the Dominican nuns.</p>
<p class="par">That of Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora del Rosario, founded in
Lingay&eacute;n (Pangasin&aacute;n), in 1890, with 60 pupils; that of
Santa Imelda, founded in Tuguegarao (Cagay&aacute;n de Luz&oacute;n),
in 1892, with 81 pupils; that of Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora del Rosario, in
Vigan (Ilocos Sur), with 90 pupils; and finally, that of San
Jos&eacute; de Jaro, under the direction of the sisters of charity,
with 116 resident pupils, 160 day, and 14 half-boarders. <span class=

<p class="par">Lastly, centers also devoted to the instruction of girls
are the Real Casa de Misericordia in Ceb&uacute;, the beaterio of the
Society of Jesus in Manila, and those of Santa Rita in Pasig, and San
Sebasti&aacute;n in Calumpang. However, we shall not review them here,

following results of a table show the following statistics in regard to
girls&rsquo; schools between the years 1864&ndash;1883. Santa Catalina:
boarding pupils, 1,617; teachers, 7. Santa Rosa: boarding pupils,
2,959; teachers, 23. Concordia: boarding pupils, 2,103; day pupils,
623; teachers, 32. Santa Isabel: free boarding pupils, 475; pay
boarding pupils, 149; day pupils, 112. Municipal school: day pupils,
5,163; teachers, 74; awards conferred, 332; accesit, 1,058. The
instruction given in these institutions was always under the immediate
direction of the friars, and was consequently of a religious character.
Some of them were known as <i lang="es">beaterios</i> or retreats,
institutions devoted primarily to religious practice. Primary and
secondary instruction were both given. In some of them the instruction
was very poor, as many of the scholars graduated without knowing how to
speak Spanish. It was only in the college of Santa Isabel, in the
municipal school, and in some private schools that adequate instruction
was given. Some of these colleges were houses of recreation or of rest
rather than educational institutions, where not only girls, but women,
both married and single, went to pass some time, for the purpose of
change or to renew their clothing. Girls from the provinces often
attended the schools in Manila to learn the social manners and polish
of the capital, but they often failed of their purpose, for social
education was frequently neglected in them. The class distinction
between Spanish, mestizo, and Filipino girls was unfortunately
inculcated. The principal ends of the sisters of charity being the care
of their convents and hospitals, they could not obtain as good results
in education as if their time had been spent entirely in that field.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The Manila school of agriculture was created by
royal decree of November 29, 1887, and established at Manila, July 2,
1889.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4929src" href="#xd21e4929" name=

"pagenum">[<a id="pb316" href="#pb316" name=
"pb316">316</a>]</span>were: the theoretical and practical education of
skilled farmers; the education of overseers; the promotion of
agricultural development in the Philippines, by means of observation,
experiment, and investigation. In order to enter officially into the
study of scientific agriculture, it was necessary to be vouched for by
a valid certificate, to be of good health, and to have studied and have
passed examinations in some institution of secondary education, or
other properly accredited institution. It opened with 82 students, but
in the following year there were only 50. Agricultural stations were
established in Isabela de Luz&oacute;n, Ilocos, Albay, Ceb&uacute;,
Ilo&iacute;lo, Leyte, Mindanao, and Jol&oacute;. Those of Jol&oacute;
and Leyte were abolished by royal decrees, dated September 10, 1888,
and December 7, 1891, respectively. The course of studies was as
follows: First year&mdash;elements of agriculture; mathematical
problems; practical work in topography; linear and topographical
drawing. Second year&mdash;special methods of cultivation; elements of
stockbreeding; agricultural arts; practical work in cultivation and the
industries; setting up and management of machines; drawing applied to
machines and to plants. Third year&mdash;elements of rural economy;
accounts and agricultural legislation; general practical work in
cultivation, stockbreeding, and industry; drawing of plans. The
education of the overseers was carried on in the agricultural stations,
which have been created for the purpose of doing technical work in
analyses of earth, systems of irrigation, studies of seed,
acclimatization of vegetables and animals, study and treatment of
epizootic, epiphysis, etc. The professors in the school were
agricultural engineers and their assistants <span class=

entirely by the government, but the direction was in the hands of the
priests. The university of Santo Tom&aacute;s, both of itself, and
through the Ateneo Municipal, issued certificates to skilled farmers
and surveyors, for which it required mathematics, physics, chemistry,
natural history, agriculture, topography, and linear and topographical
drawing. The government school cannot be said to have been a success,
for the Filipinos, while inclined to readily adopt the professions,
have never shown any marked inclination for industrial pursuits.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Since American occupancy.</i> By section 19 of act 74
of the Philippine Commission it was provided that there should be
established and maintained a school of agriculture in the island of
Negros, and by section 24 of the same act, the sum of $15,000 was
appropriated out of any funds in the insular treasury not otherwise
appropriated for the organization and maintenance of the school for the
year 1901. It was suggested that such a school be established on the
government plantation at La Carlota, but it is an inaccessible place,
and it was proposed to find a more convenient place. The organization
of the school was delayed in order to bring it into connection with the
proposed experimental sugar plantation in Negros. By act no. 512,
passed November 10, 1902, the work of establishing an agricultural
college was transferred from the bureau of public instruction to the
bureau of agriculture, and the government farm at La Granja in western
Negros was set aside as a site for this school, and for an experiment
station to be conducted in connection with it. After a long delay,
plans were submitted for a main building to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb318" href="#pb318" name=
"pb318">318</a>]</span>contain laboratories, class-rooms, offices, and
also a dormitory. Twenty-five thousand dollars were appropriated for
its construction. Arrangements were made, however, by which certain
teachers in the provinces were to be employed to co&ouml;perate with
the bureau of agriculture in making various experiments and in
gathering such information as might be useful in promoting knowledge of
the agricultural conditions of the islands. At the same time the law
establishing secondary instruction in provincial schools provided for
the extension of the curriculum beyond the ordinary course of
high-school instruction and instruction in agriculture, which meant
that the provincial schools might, on a larger or smaller scale, as the
authorities of the province might determine, carry on instruction and
experiments in such branches of agriculture as might be supposed to be
adapted to the conditions in the province in which any provincial
school was established. March 25, 1903, a director of the experiment
station was appointed in order that he might take charge of the
government property on the estate and begin the work of getting land
under cultivation.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4954src" href=

exercises of the school. The school was to be composed for a time of
one botanical professor, director at the same time of the botanical
garden, with a salary of 2,000 pesos; of two teachers of horticulture,
at salaries of 500 pesos; of ten workmen chosen from the pupils, who
being relieved at three year periods, were to receive 100 pesos apiece
annually; while the municipalities could name certain pensioners to
study in the school. The sum of 2,000 pesos annually was set aside for
the material expenses of the garden and school, and the purchase of
plants and tools. The total expense of both institutions was fixed at
6,000 pesos&mdash;3,000 being paid by the public treasury, 1,500 by the

<p class="par first">CONFERENCE ON THE COLLEGE-UNIVERSITY OF SANTO
TOM&Aacute;S OF MANILA, AND THE DECISION RENDERED BY SE&Ntilde;ORS
MONTERO RIOS, GAMAZO, AND MAURA</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first"><i>Conference</i></p>
<p class="par">1. Whether in view of the writ of foundation of the
college-university of Santo Tom&aacute;s, which is enclosed, the
ministry has the right to reorganize education therein, without taking
account of the religious corporation of the Dominicans.</p>
<p class="par">2. Whether, in case of a ministerial resolution,
contrary to the native autonomy of the said college, the latter may
offer opposition by legal means, and what would be the most efficacious
method.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Decision</i></p>
<p class="par">The foundation of the college of Santo Tom&aacute;s,
which seems to have been commenced under the advocacy of our Lady of
the Rosary, in Manila, was ordained by a writ of April 28, 1611, before
the notary of his Majesty, Juan Yll&aacute;n, in order to observe the
last will of the deceased archbishop, Fray Miguel de Benavides; and to
the new institution were applied <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb320"
href="#pb320" name="pb320">320</a>]</span>besides, the few resources
which the latter left, and others also modest, which proceeded from the
estates of Pablo Rodriguez de Aranjo and Anfr&eacute;s de Hermosa.
There were hopes that new liberalities would augment the capital of so
useful a work. Its origin is, then, entirely private.</p>
<p class="par">Section 1 of the said foundation spiritualized the
properties and their future increases, so that use might be made of
them under such concept for the ministry of the college, and the
welfare of the souls of the three deceased testators, and of future
benefactors. Section 2 entrusted the management to the then or future
father provincial of the Order of Preachers of St. Dominic. Section 3
gave the government correction, and instruction of the college to the
prior of the convent of that order in Manila. Section 4 allowed the
provincial, as patron, to appoint the lecturers who were to give the
instruction, and the workmen and helpers necessary for the good
administration and for the temporal government, except that if any
ecclesiastical or secular person were to endow the college with a large
sum, the chapter of the province could give him the patronage, provided
that he did not introduce any innovation, contrary to the authority of
the father provincial in respect to the provision of lectures, or
withdraw the college from the Order and province [of the Preachers], or
deprive the prior of the management. Section 5 established that the
arts and sciences should always be read and taught in the college by
the religious of the province and Order [of the Preachers], and not by
any other order, or by seculars. The same was true in regard to the
religious pupils, and for the secular collegiates. Section 6 permitted
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb321" href="#pb321" name=
"pb321">321</a>]</span>admission of bequests, gifts, and other aids
weighted with charges of piety, which the convent was to fulfil and
observe [<i lang="es">levantaria</i>]. Section 7 gave to the provincial
chapter the power to make new rules and regulations, both in regard to
the distribution and administration of the properties, and in what
related to the ministry and instruction, and to appoint a rector. Those
rules once made were not to be changed without the special authority
and order of his Holiness. Section 10 says: &ldquo;If at any time, any
ecclesiastical or secular prince should try by act and right to
exercise any power by way of patronage or in any other manner, in order
to try to dispose of the properties and incomes of the said college, or
to meddle with the administration and government of it, or hinder and
disturb its effect in any way and manner whatever, and by means of any
judge or powerful person, or by any other person who may do it, from
that time and thenceforth, we apply the said properties and estates
with which the said college is founded, and all the others which shall
be augmented and applied, and which it shall receive in any manner, to
the said province and to the religious of the said order, so that the
latter may possess and enjoy as its own properties, acquired by just
and right title, all of that property with the said houses and college,
and their increases and improvements. We consider this foundation
[under such circumstances] as null and void, and as if it had never
been made. The said order is charged to be careful to say masses and
other benefices and suffrages for the souls of the said archbishop and
the others with whose alms and properties this foundation is begun, and
all of those who, in the future, in any time and manner, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb322" href="#pb322" name=
"pb322">322</a>]</span>shall leave and apply any other properties to
it, so that by this way satisfaction may be given on the part of the
said province, for the said alms, to the givers of those
alms.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Although the writ of 1611 does not indicate that its
signers thought of it, the royal license was inexcusable. According to
law i, t&iacute;tulo iii, book i, of <i lang="es">Recopilaci&oacute;n
de las leyes de Indias</i>, it was ordered from the time of Felipe II
that permission should be petitioned before the building of a church,
convent, or hospice, for the conversion and instruction of the natives,
and the preaching of the holy gospel. Law ii of t&iacute;tulo vi,
devoted especially to the royal patronage, ordered that no cathedral or
parish church, monastery, hospital, or votive church, should be
erected, instituted, founded, or constructed in any other pious or
religious place, without the express permit of his Majesty. However,
law xliii, of the same t&iacute;tulo, rules that when any person wishes
to found a monastery, hospital, hermitage, church, or other pious and
charitable work in Indias, from his own property, the will of the
founders shall be observed, and the persons appointed and summoned
shall have the patronage. The attributes of the royal patronage which
declare that &ldquo;our permission shall be received beforehand for
whatever is needed,&rdquo; shall always be reserved.</p>
<p class="par">Royal permission, beyond any doubt, was obtained,
although by an indirect method. For law liii, of t&iacute;tulo xxii,
[book i] (which treats of universities and general and private studies
in the Yndias) declares that &ldquo;by the license of the ordinary and
governor of the Filipinas Islands, and the decision of the royal
Audiencia of those islands, the religious of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb323" href="#pb323" name=
"pb323">323</a>]</span>Order of St. Dominic in the city of Manila,
founded a college where grammar, arts, and theology were read, in which
they placed two religious of each branch, and twenty secular
collegiates. Great gain resulted therefrom,&rdquo; and it is ordered
that for the present and so long as his Majesty orders no other thing,
&ldquo;the religious make use of the license which the governor gave
them for the foundation.&rdquo; That was not to be understood &ldquo;to
the prejudice of what was ordained in regard to similar foundations, so
that they should not be instituted or commenced without express
permission&rdquo; from the king.</p>
<p class="par">With such requirements, respect for the foundation is
declared not only by the judicial force of the foundation itself, but
also by the above-cited law xliii of t&iacute;tulo vi; for that respect
is equally capable of being required from persons and authorities who
are strange to the institution, and from the patrons, administrators,
and ministers of the institution itself. The will of such patrons would
have no power against the fundamental law whence proceeds their
authority. Their end is to preserve and obey that law strictly, and to
cause it to be respected by others without any change or violation of
it by them. The admissible innovations in the institutions under
discussion have the limit and form which were laid down by the
foundation. Consequently, therefore, those innovations which might have
been made in the patronage, in the administrative management, or in the
academical order, provided that they respected that limit and observed
the jurisdiction and formality laid down by the writ of 1611, could not
be considered as violations, but as faithful applications of the
peculiar law of the college. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb324" href=
"#pb324" name="pb324">324</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The first part of the conference admits only the
following categorical reply: &ldquo;In the college-university, the
ministry has no right to reorganize the instruction.&rdquo; It has a
right, beyond any doubt, to organize the public instruction in Manila,
in the manner which it considers most adequate for obtaining the ends
of the same. One of the fundamentals which it may adopt could be the
elimination [as teachers] of the fathers of the said order. But that
will not fall within the college whose foundation we have before us,
and the funds and properties of the same cannot be applied totally or
partially to the university or college which the government may erect
in such manner.</p>
<p class="par">The section of reversion, literally copied above, will
have its desired effect fully, in the case under consultation (unless
permission is given to reconstitute the private institution in regard
to the ruling of the writ of 1611), with entire independence of the
academical institutions of the state. The disagreement [<i lang=
"es">disyuntiva</i>] would be between this and the reversion of the
properties. Therefore, it is sufficient to call to mind the succinct
but faithful review which has been made of the cardinal fundamentals of
the foundation, in order to have proved that the reorganization of
education, which the ministry of the colonies, laying aside all
consideration of the community [<i>i.e.</i>, of the Dominicans], might
order, would wound and destroy in an essential manner, the will of the
founders. If that should happen, the province of Sant&iacute;simo
Rosario and the Dominican religious of the province, would not only
have the right to recover the properties, and give them the pious
application assigned by the section, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb325" href="#pb325" name="pb325">325</a>]</span>but also would not
have the power to refrain from it, and consent that such properties
remain applied to the needs of the teaching institution reorganized by
the government. The patrons of a charitable fund, or any other
permanent foundation, can never convert the authority of such contrary
to the observance and purity of the institution confided to their care.
The acts of the patrons, contrary to the foundation, possess the vice
of nullity.</p>
<p class="par">The lawyers undersigned have no exact and minute
information of the vicissitudes which the college-university has
experienced from 1611 to the present day. Comparing alone the royal
decree of October 29, 1875, which reorganized the instruction of the
said college with the writ of its primitive foundation, it appears that
some rulings of the former are at variance with the latter: for
example, article 3, which declares that the orders, plans, programs,
and regulations, which emanate from the ministry and in that case from
the governor-general, are obligatory for the organization and rule of
education; article 6, and the following ones which allowed entrance to
secular professors and defined their emoluments and fees; article 11,
which reserved to the ministry the power of fixing the fees of
matriculation, degrees, titles, and certificates; and article 13, which
obliged the rector to render an annual account to the royal vice-patron
of the emoluments and expenses of the university, the order supplying
the deficit resulting. But we are not consulting as to the greater or
less legal stability of the present condition of the institution or if
we were treating of it, it would not be within our province to disavow
that in other things of great importance, the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb326" href="#pb326" name=
"pb326">326</a>]</span>government still respected the fundamentals of
the foundation, and that the concessions which were made in 1875 in
exchange for obtaining by entreaty the abolition of the decrees of
November 6, 1870,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5021src" href="#xd21e5021"
name="xd21e5021src">1</a> appeared practically corroborated by the
lasting agreement of the patrons and of those summoned to obtain the
properties by virtue of the clause of reversion, although in strict
rigor of law the document of the foundation ought to take precedence
over any act and any submission of its natural guardians.</p>
<p class="par">For the concrete matter of our opinion, we have only to
declare that we do not believe that the former more or less extreme
mildness of the patrons in the presence of the interference, which
rejected the foundation, weakens the actions of the patronage of the
college and of the ecclesiastical province favored by the clause of
reversion in order to demand the observance of the foundation, if,
perchance, the ministry of the colonies, exercising powers which
indubitably belong to it, reorganize the instruction of the university
without considering the religious community of the Dominicans. Even in
the hypothesis of considering as illegal the tolerances or concessions
of former times, the foundation, pure and simple, is the criterion and
only norm with which the dispute can be adjusted.</p>
<p class="par">The second point of the conference offers no difficulty
in whatever concerns the existence of a legal means for opposing a
resolution of a government contrary to the native autonomy of the
college. Leaving aside the attributes of the ministry to direct the
services of education as it deems most suitable, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb327" href="#pb327" name=
"pb327">327</a>]</span>whenever they are sustained by the public funds,
the opposition, if it limit itself to the use of the properties and
funds from private origin, which today endow the institution, would
have a legal mean beyond any doubt, to demand the strict observance of
the law of foundation.</p>
<p class="par">What would this mean be, or which of the two possible
means appears more efficacious? Would it be by bringing the complaint
before the court of <i lang=
"es">contencioso-administrativo</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e5037src"
href="#xd21e5037" name="xd21e5037src">2</a> or before the ordinary
justice? <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb328" href="#pb328" name=
"pb328">328</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The law of September 13, 1888, applicable to Filipinas,
according to article 4 of its transitory rulings, marks the bound of
the jurisdiction of the court of <i lang=
"es">contencioso-administrativo</i>. Perhaps the generic notes of
article 1 of the said law would be found in a manner suited to the
resolution of the ministry. That article would occasion a report
[<i lang="es">estado</i>]. In what concerns the application of the
properties and the incomes of the institution, it would emanate from
powers subject to rule, and not discretional, and would wound a
pre&euml;xisting right of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb329" href=
"#pb329" name="pb329">329</a>]</span>a certain administrative
character. For, besides the original royal permission and that of the
protectorate general in regard to the foundations, the public
administration has intervened, intertwining the public service of the
instruction of that university with the private foundation. But article
4 of the law excepts the questions of a civil nature, and of the
competency of the ordinary jurisdiction, the questions in which the
right violated may be of a civil character, and also those which
emanate from acts in which the administration has taken part as a legal
person, or as one subject to rights and obligations. Of a character
essentially civil would be the right violated by the hypothetical
ministerial decision of which we are treating, reducing to accidental
mixtures the ancient connections of the college founded by private
persons, with the administration, which was advantageous to the
opportunities which the college offered for the service of education.
In strict terms one might add that the government, although it would
perform judicial acts as a public power, in determining the future
system of education, in exchange ought to be considered as a legal
person, in so far as it should attempt to obtain by entreaty from the
patrons of the college, the aid of the properties and incomes of the
legal person incarnate in them. But the notoriously civil character of
the laws which are involved in the observance of the foundation of 1611
are sufficient so that we might consider as definitive that the courts
of justice would be those summoned to impose on the government respect
for the will of the institutors, the owners of the properties with
which the college is endowed. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb330"
href="#pb330" name="pb330">330</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">But not because we do so understand it (as without
vacillation we do understand it), can we advise that the <i lang=
"es">contencioso-administrativo</i> demand be left out of the claim.
Action must be begun in its proper time and manner before the special
court, with the intention that on that court rejecting the demand, as
outside its peculiar jurisdiction, it would leave out of all doubt the
jurisdiction of the common court. In this manner, it is probable that
the attempt would be made to take advantage of the ambiguity, and
maintain that the result of the deliberation had been consented to
because of the lack of the other appeal, confusing with episodical and
accidental discussions the controversy over the substantial and
fundamental matter. The preliminary attempt of <i lang=
"es">contencioso-administrativo</i> appeal causes no disgrace to civil
actions which have a longer life.</p>
<p class="par">In conclusion then, the undersigned believe:</p>
<p class="par">1. That, although the ministry of the colonies can alter
at its discretion the system of public education in Manila, it has no
right to apply the funds and properties of a private origin, today
assigned to the college-university of Santo Tom&aacute;s, to the
establishment which it organizes, without considering the religious
corporation of the Dominicans, or by infringing in any other manner on
the foundation of the said college. Consequently, it cannot make any
similar reorganization in that college.</p>
<p class="par">2. That, if a ministerial decision shall be dictated
contrary to the sacred and inviolable law of the foundation of the
college, the most efficacious legal means to oppose the violation of
the same and obtain its observance by entreaty would be to bring an
ordinary civil suit before the courts of common <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb331" href="#pb331" name="pb331">331</a>]</span>law,
but in order to free the road of the difficulties of this suit it would
be advisable to try previously the <i lang=
"es">contencioso-administrativo</i> appeal, in the time and manner
assigned by the law of September 13, 1888.</p>
<p class="par">This is our opinion, but we will give place to any other
that is better founded.</p>

Concerning this court, the first report of the Philippine Taft
Commission, <i>Historical resum&eacute; of the administration of
justice in the Philippine Islands</i>, by Cayetano S. Arellano, chief
justice of the supreme court, pp. 228&ndash;230, says: &ldquo;This
court&mdash;in English, Contentious Court&mdash;arose from the
establishment of a council of administration in these islands under the
provisions of a royal decree of July 4, 1861, which surrounded the
governor-general of these islands, who was president of the court, with
prominent men who advised him by their votes on consultation. This
contentious court consisted of three officials of judiciary, the
president and two magistrates appointed by turn among those
constituting the personnel of the Audiencia, with the exception of the
presidents of the branches and two officials of the administration, who
were known as the administrative magistrates; subsequently, by royal
decree of the third of June, 1866, the court was reduced to a president
and three magistrates. This court took cognizance of suits brought by
private persons against the State, whenever they were litigated.
Complaints of private individuals against the administration of the
State, if not subject to litigation, could, after presentation of
appeals to the governor-general of the islands, be taken upon a
recourse of complaint to the colonial office in Spain if no relief was
obtained under the decision of the governor-general.&rdquo; A decree of
February 7, 1869, provided that the &ldquo;contentious administrative
jurisdiction, which was exercised by the councils of administration of
the provinces of the colonies should in the future rest in the
territorial audiencias of those provinces; that, for the exercise of
this jurisdiction, there should be organized in each Audiencia, as is
done here, a department composed of the president of the same and the
two presidents of the branches, the representative of the State being
the attorney-general. The theory upon which the former organization of
this contentious administrative tribunal rested was the administration
of the State in respect to its litigation with subjects. The
judge-advocate was both judge and litigant at the same time. However,
the decree of the seventh of February, 1869, inspired by the principles
proclaimed by the revolution, was that these questions should be
decided in the same manner as any other issue between private
individuals. These suits, as has been seen, were brought in first
instance before the Audiencia of the territory; consequently, appeals
in second instance lay before the supreme court of justice of Spain.
But by the other theory the first instance pertained to the contentious
tribunal of the council of administration, and second instance of the
council of State of Spain, to which appeals might be taken against
decisions of the former court. But this reform, well received, both in
Spain and in the colonies, was of short duration, for one of the first
acts of the government of the monarchical restoration was the
re&euml;stablishment of the contentious court in the same form in which
it had existed prior to the reform of the royal decree of the
nineteenth of March, 1875.&rdquo; This court lasted until the end of

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
